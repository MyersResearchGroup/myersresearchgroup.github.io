## Website Structure Overview

* The general file structure looks like this: https://wowchemy.com/docs/get-started/#remove-any-unused-example-pages
* You can figure out which folders correspond to which tabs on the menu by looking at menus.toml under config\_default
        -for example the "People" tab can be accessed via <website url>/People-Genetic-Logic-Lab and the web code for the content of the page is found under content/People-Genetic-Logic-Lab
* Individual webpages are built using the index.md or _index.md file in the content folder. There are two types of index file:
       -_index.md: it is a simple functionality that displays the rest of the content from the folder based on the view style chosen. It is flanked by "---" at the start and end of the file. Example:
