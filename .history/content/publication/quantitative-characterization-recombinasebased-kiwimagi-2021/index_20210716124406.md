abstract: Many synthetic gene circuits are restricted to single-use applications or
  require iterative refinement for incorporation into complex systems. One example
  is the recombinase-based digitizer circuit, which has been used to improve weak
  or leaky biological signals. Here we present a workflow to quantitatively define
  digitizer performance and predict responses to different input signals. Using a
  combination of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), area under a receiver operating characteristic
  curve (AUC), and fold change (FC), we evaluate three small-molecule inducible digitizer
  designs demonstrating FC up to 508x and SNR up to 3.77 dB. To study their behavior
  further and improve modularity, we develop a mixed phenotypic/mechanistic model
  capable of predicting digitizer configurations that amplify a synNotch cell-to-cell
  communication signal ($Î”$ SNR up to 2.8 dB). We hope the metrics and modeling approaches
  here will facilitate incorporation of these digitizers into other systems while
  providing an improved workflow for gene circuit characterization. Kiwimagi & Letendre
  et al. present a workflow to quantitatively define recombinase-based digitizer and
  predict responses to different input signals. With a mechanistic/phenotypic model
  that can predict circuit performance, they generate a synthetic cell-cell communication
  device that amplifies a synNotch output signal.
