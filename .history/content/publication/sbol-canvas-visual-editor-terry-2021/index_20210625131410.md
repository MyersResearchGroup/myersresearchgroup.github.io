abstract: SBOLCanvas is a web-based application that can create and edit genetic constructs
  using the SBOL data and visual standards. SBOLCanvas allows a user to create a genetic
  design visually and structurally from start to finish. It also allows users to incorporate
  existing SBOL data from a SynBioHub repository. By the nature of being a web-based
  application, SBOLCanvas is readily accessible and easy to use. A live version of
  the latest release can be found at https://sbolcanvas.org.
