abstract: With this work, a containerized API was created that is capable of automating
  the simulation of genetic circuits designed in SBOLCanvas using the working parts
  of the iBioSim tool. This API will help in the Design, Build, Test, Learn (DBTL)
  workflow for research in synthetic biology.
