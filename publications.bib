	abstract = {This paper presents a decomposition-based method for timed circuit design that is capable of significantly reducing the cost of synthesis. In particular, this method synthesizes each output individually. It begins by contracting the timed signal transition graph ({STG}) to include only transitions on the output of interest and its possible trigger signals. Next, the reachable state space for this contracted {STG} is analyzed to determine a minimal number of additional signals, which must be reintroduced into the {STG} to obtain complete state coding. The circuit for this output is then synthesized from this {STG}. Results show that the quality of the circuit implementation is nearly as good as the one found from the full reachable state space, but it can be applied to find circuits for which full-state-space methods cannot be successfully applied. The proposed method has been implemented as a part of our tool Nii-Utah Timed Asynchronous circuit Synthesis system (nutas), and its first version is available at http://research.nii.ac.jp/ yoneda.},

However, substantial work remains to create accurate comprehensive models of complex cells. Methods: We organized the 2015 Whole-Cell Modeling Summer School to teach {WC} modeling and evaluate the need for new {WC} modeling standards and software by recoding a recently published {WC} model in the Systems Biology Markup Language. Results: Our analysis revealed several challenges to representing {WC} models using the current standards. Conclusion: We, therefore, propose several new {WC} modeling standards, software, and databases. Significance: We anticipate that these new standards and software will enable more comprehensive models.},

	abstract = {Multiple input changes can cause unwanted switching variations, or glitches, in the output of genetic combinational circuits. These glitches can have drastic effects if the output of the circuit causes irreversible changes within or with other cells such as a cascade of responses, apoptosis, or the release of a pharmaceutical in an off-target tissue. Therefore, avoiding unwanted variation of a circuit’s output can be crucial for the safe operation of a genetic circuit. This paper investigates what causes unwanted switching variations in combinational genetic circuits using hazard analysis and a new dynamic model generator. The analysis is done in previously built and modeled genetic circuits with known glitching behavior. The dynamic models generated not only predict the same steady states as previous models but can also predict the unwanted switching variations that have been observed experimentally. Multiple input changes may cause glitches due to propagation delays within the circuit. Modifying the circuit’s layout to alter these delays may change the likelihood of certain glitches, but it cannot eliminate the possibility that the glitch may occur. In other words, function hazards cannot be eliminated. Instead, they must be avoided by restricting the allowed input changes to the system. Logic hazards, on the other hand, can be avoided using hazard-free logic synthesis. This paper demonstrates this by showing how a circuit designed using a popular genetic design automation tool can be redesigned to eliminate logic hazards.},

Their timed circuits also tend to be more efficient, in both speed and area, compared with traditional asynchronous circuits. The synthesis procedure begins with a cyclic graph specification to which timing constraints can be added. First, the cyclic graph is unfolded into an infinite acyclic graph. Then, an analysis of two finite subgraphs of the infinite acyclic graph detects and removes redundancy in the original specification based on the given timing constraints. From this reduced specification, an implementation that is guaranteed to function correctly under the timing constraints is systematically synthesized. With practical circuit examples, it is demonstrated that the resulting timed implementation is significantly reduced in complexity compared with implementations previously derived using other methodologies.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Second, new glyphs are added for proteins, introns, and polypeptide regions (e. g., protein domains), the prior recommended macromolecule glyph is deprecated in favor of its alternative, and small polygons are introduced as alternative glyphs for simple chemicals.},

	abstract = {As improvements in {DNA} synthesis technology and assembly methods make combinatorial assembly of genetic constructs increasingly accessible, methods for representing genetic constructs likewise need to improve to handle the exponential growth of combinatorial design space. To this end, we present a community accepted extension of the {SBOL} data standard that allows for the efficient and flexible encoding of combinatorial designs. This extension includes data structures for representing genetic designs with “variable” components that can be implemented by choosing one of many linked designs for existing genetic parts or constructs. We demonstrate the representational power of the {SBOL} combinatorial design extension through case studies on metabolic pathway design and genetic circuit design, and we report the expansion of the {SBOLDesigner} software tool to support users in creating and modifying combinatorial designs in {SBOL}.},

	abstract = {Standard representation of data is key for the reproducibility of designs in synthetic biology. The Synthetic Biology Open Language ({SBOL}) has already emerged as a data standard to represent information about genetic circuits, and it is based on capturing data using graphs. The language provides the syntax using a free text document that is accessible to humans only. This paper describes {SBOL}-{OWL}, an ontology for a machine understandable definition of {SBOL}. This ontology acts as a semantic layer for genetic circuit designs. As a result, computational tools can understand the meaning of design entities in addition to parsing structured {SBOL} data. {SBOL}-{OWL} not only describes how genetic circuits can be constructed computationally, it also facilitates the use of several existing Semantic Web tools for synthetic biology. This paper demonstrates some of these features, for example, to validate designs and check for inconsistencies. Through the use of {SBOL}-{OWL}, queries can be simplified and become more intuitive. Moreover, existing reasoners can be used to infer information about genetic circuit designs that cannot be directly retrieved using existing querying mechanisms. This ontological representation of the {SBOL} standard provides a new perspective to the verification, representation, and querying of information about genetic circuits and is important to incorporate complex design information via the integration of biological ontologies.},

The synthetic biology open language ({SBOL}) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology, filling a need not satisfied by other pre-existing standards. This document details version 2.3.0 of {SBOL}, which builds upon version 2.2.0 published in last year’s {JIB} Standards in Systems Biology special issue. In particular, {SBOL} 2.3.0 includes means of succinctly representing sequence modifications, such as insertion, deletion, and replacement, an extension to support organization and attachment of experimental data derived from designs, and an extension for describing numerical parameters of design elements. The new version also includes specifying types of synthetic biology activities, unambiguous locations for sequences with multiple encodings, refinement of a number of validation rules, improved figures and examples, and clarification on a number of issues related to the use of external ontology terms.},

This paper introduces a new approximation method to reduce the computational cost of stochastic simulations of an enzymatic reaction scheme which in biochemical systems often includes rapidly changing fast reactions with enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex molecules present in very small counts. Our new method removes the substrate dissociation reaction by approximating the passage time of the formation of each enzyme-substrate complex molecule which is destined to a production reaction. This approach skips the firings of unimportant yet expensive reaction events, resulting in a substantial acceleration in the stochastic simulations of enzymatic reactions. Additionally, since all the parameters used in our new approach can be derived by the Michaelis-Menten parameters which can actually be measured from experimental data, applications of this approximation can be practical even without having full knowledge of the underlying enzymatic reaction. Here, we apply this new method to various enzymatic reaction systems, resulting in a speedup of orders of magnitude in temporal behavior analysis without any significant loss in accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our new method can perform better than some of the best existing approximation methods for enzymatic reactions in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

A designated set of delay parameters of a circuit are first set to sufficiently large bounds, and verification runs followed by failure analysis are repeated. Each verification run performs timed state space enumeration under the given delay bounds, and produces a failure trace if it exists. The failure trace is analyzed, and sufficient timing constraints to prevent the failure are obtained. Then, the delay bounds are tightened according to the timing constraints by using an {ILP} (Integer Linear Programming) solver. This process terminates when either some delay bounds under which no failure is detected are found or no new delay bounds to prevent the failures can be obtained.

The abstraction preserves all essential behaviors conservatively for the specific failure model in the concrete description. Therefore, no violations of the given failure model are missed when only the abstract description is analyzed.

Analog circuits may require less area and power than digital implementations in high-speed iterative applications. Our (8, 4) Hamming decoder, implemented in an {AMI} 0.5-/spl mu/m process, is the first functioning {CMOS} analog {MAP} decoder. While designed to operate in subthreshold, the decoder also functions above threshold with a small performance penalty. The chip has been tested at bit rates up to 2 Mb/s, and simulations indicate a top speed of about 10 Mb/s in strong inversion. The decoder circuit size is 0.82 mm/sup 2/, and typical power consumption is 1 {mW} at 1 Mb/s.},

The synthesis procedure begins with a graph specification with timing constraints. A timing analysis extracts the timed concurrency and timed causality relations directly from the specification. Then, a hazard-free implementation of the specification is synthesized by analyzing precedence graphs which are constructed by using the timed concurrency and timed causality relations. The major result of this work is that the method does not suffer from the state explosion problem, in practice achieves significant reductions in synthesis time for the specifications which have a large state space, and generates synthesized circuits that have nearly the same area as compared to previous timed circuit methods. In particular, this paper shows that a timed circuit-not containing circuit hazards under given timing constraints-can be found by using the relations between signal transitions of the specification. Moreover, the relations can be efficiently found using a heuristic timing analysis algorithm. By allowing significantly larger designs to be synthesized, this work is a step toward the development of high-level synthesis tools for system level asynchronous circuits.},

Our design eliminates potential metastability problems by using a clock generated by a stoppable ring oscillator, which is capable of driving the large clock load found in present day microprocessors. Using the {ATACS} design tool, we designed highly optimized transistor-level circuits to control the ring oscillator and generate the clock and handshake signals with minimal overhead. Our interface architecture requires no redesign of the synchronous circuitry. Incorporating asynchronous modules in a high-speed pipeline improves performance by exploiting data-dependent delay variations. Since the speed of the synchronous circuitry tracks the speed of the ring oscillator under different processes, temperatures, and voltages, the entire chip operates at the speed dictated by the current operating conditions, rather than being governed by the worst case conditions. These two factors together can lead to a significant improvement in average-case performance. The interface design is simulated using the 0.6-/spl mu/m {HP} {CMOS}14B process in {HSPICE}.},

It is among the first genetic technology mapping algorithms to adapt techniques from electronic circuit design, in particular the use of a cost function to guide the search for an optimal solution, and perhaps that which makes the greatest use of standards for describing genetic function and structure to represent design specifications and component libraries. This paper demonstrates the use of our algorithm to map the specifications for three different genetic circuits against four randomly generated libraries of increasing size to evaluate its performance against both exhaustive search and greedy variants for finding optimal and near-optimal solutions.},

Finally, when modeling a dynamic cellular population within {iBioSim}, inlining the hierarchy of the model is inefficient since models must grow dynamically over time. This paper discusses a new approach to handle hierarchy on the fly to make the tool faster and more memory-efficient.

This framework takes as input a system model described as a network of communicating components in a high-level description language, finds the local state transition models for each individual component where local properties can be verified, and then iteratively reduces and composes the component state transition models to form a reduced global model for the entire system where global safety properties can be verified. The state space reductions used in this framework result in a reduced model that contains the exact same set of observably equivalent executions as in the original model, therefore, no false counter-examples result from the verification of the reduced model. This approach allows designs that cannot be handled monolithically or with partial-order reduction to be verified without difficulty.

The {SBML} Hierarchical Model Composition package for {SBML} Level 3 adds the necessary features to {SBML} to support hierarchical modeling. The package enables a modeler to include submodels within an enclosing {SBML} model, delete unneeded or redundant elements of that submodel, replace elements of that submodel with element of the containing model, and replace elements of the containing model with elements of the submodel. In addition, the package defines an optional “port” construct, allowing a model to be defined with suggested interfaces between hierarchical components; modelers can chose to use these interfaces, but they are not required to do so and can still interact directly with model elements if they so chose. Finally, the {SBML} Hierarchical Model Composition package is defined in such a way that a hierarchical model can be “flattened” to an equivalent, non-hierarchical version that uses only plain {SBML} constructs, thus enabling software tools that do not yet support hierarchy to nevertheless work with {SBML} hierarchical models.},

There are yearly two meeting, {HARMONY} (Hackathons on Resources for Modeling in Biology), Hackathon-type meetings with a focus on development of the support for standards, and {COMBINE} forums, workshop-style events with oral presentations, discussion, poster, and breakout sessions for further developing the standards. For more information see http://co.mbine.org/. So far the different standards were published and made accessible through the standards’ web-pages or preprint services. The aim of this special issue is to provide a single, easily accessible and citable platform for the publication of standards in systems and synthetic biology. This special issue is intended to serve as a central access point to standards and related initiatives in systems and synthetic biology, it will be published annually to provide an opportunity for standard development groups to communicate updated specifications.},

	abstract = {The Systems Biology Markup Language ({SBML}) has been widely used for modeling biological systems. Although {SBML} has been successful in representing a wide variety of biochemical models, the core standard lacks the structure for representing large complex regular systems in a standard way, such as whole-cell and cellular population models. These models require a large number of variables to represent certain aspects of these types of models, such as the chromosome in the whole-cell model and the many identical cell models in a cellular population. While {SBML} core is not designed to handle these types of models efficiently, the proposed {SBML} arrays package can represent such regular structures more easily. However, in order to take full advantage of the package, analysis needs to be aware of the arrays structure. When expanding the array constructs within a model, some of the advantages of using arrays are lost. This paper describes a more efficient way to simulate arrayed models. To illustrate the proposed method, this paper uses a population of repressilator and genetic toggle switch circuits as examples. Results show that there are memory benefits using this approach with a modest cost in runtime.},

	abstract = {Recently, we have begun to witness the potential of synthetic biology, noted here in the form of bacteria and yeast that have been genetically engineered to produce biofuels, manufacture drug precursors, and even invade tumor cells. The success of these projects, however, has often failed in translation and application to new projects, a problem exacerbated by a lack of engineering standards that combine descriptions of the structure and function of {DNA}. To address this need, this paper describes a methodology to connect the systems biology markup language ({SBML}) to the synthetic biology open language ({SBOL}), existing standards that describe biochemical models and {DNA} components, respectively. Our methodology involves first annotating {SBML} model elements such as species and reactions with {SBOL} {DNA} components. A graph is then constructed from the model, with vertices corresponding to elements within the model and edges corresponding to the cause-and-effect relationships between these elements. Lastly, the graph is traversed to assemble the annotating {DNA} components into a composite {DNA} component, which is used to annotate the model itself and can be referenced by other composite models and {DNA} components. In this way, our methodology can be used to build up a hierarchical library of models annotated with {DNA} components. Such a library is a useful input to any future genetic technology mapping algorithm that would automate the process of composing {DNA} components to satisfy a behavioral specification. Our methodology for {SBML}-to-{SBOL} annotation is implemented in the latest version of our genetic design automation ({GDA}) software tool, {iBioSim}.},

	abstract = {This paper presents results on the design and analysis of a robust genetic Muller C-element. The Muller C-element is a standard logic gate commonly used to synchronize independent processes in most asynchronous electronic circuits. Synthetic biological logic gates have been previously demonstrated, but there remain many open issues in the design of sequential (state-holding) logic operations. Three designs are considered for the genetic Muller C-element: a majority gate, a toggle switch, and a speed-independent implementation. While the three designs are logically equivalent, each design requires different assumptions to operate correctly. The majority gate design requires the most timing assumptions, the speed-independent design requires the least, and the toggle switch design is a compromise between the two. This paper examines the robustness of these designs as well as the effects of parameter variation using stochastic simulation. The results show that robustness to timing assumptions does not necessarily increase reliability, suggesting that modifications to existing logic design tools are going to be necessary for synthetic biology. Parameter variation simulations yield further insights into the design principles necessary for building robust genetic gates. The results suggest that high gene count, cooperativity of at least two, tight repression, and balanced decay rates are necessary for robust gates. Finally, this paper presents a potential application of the genetic Muller C-element as a quorum-mediated trigger.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental advances facilitate the collection of time series data that indicate which genes in a cell are expressed. This information can be used to understand the genetic regulatory network that generates the data. Typically, Bayesian analysis approaches are applied which neglect the time series nature of the experimental data, have difficulty in determining the direction of causality, and do not perform well on networks with tight feedback. To address these problems, this paper presents a method to learn genetic network connectivity which exploits the time series nature of experimental data to achieve better causal predictions. This method first breaks up the data into bins. Next, it determines an initial set of potential influence vectors for each gene based upon the probability of the gene's expression increasing in the next time step. These vectors are then combined to form new vectors with better scores. Finally, these influence vectors are competed against each other to determine the final influence vector for each gene. The result is a directed graph representation of the genetic network's repression and activation connections. Results are reported for several synthetic networks with tight feedback showing significant improvements in recall and runtime over Yu's dynamic Bayesian approach. Promising preliminary results are also reported for an analysis of experimental data for genes involved in the yeast cell cycle.},

	abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli ({UPEC}) represent the predominant cause of urinary tract infections ({UTIs}). A key {UPEC} molecular virulence mechanism is type 1 fimbriae, whose expression is controlled by the orientation of an invertible chromosomal {DNA} element—the fim switch. Temperature has been shown to act as a major regulator of fim switching behavior and is overall an important indicator as well as functional feature of many urologic diseases, including {UPEC} host-pathogen interaction dynamics. Given this panoptic physiological role of temperature during {UTI} progression and notable empirical challenges to its direct in vivo studies, in silico modeling of corresponding biochemical and biophysical mechanisms essential to {UPEC} pathogenicity may significantly aid our understanding of the underlying disease processes. However, rigorous computational analysis of biological systems, such as fim switch temperature control circuit, has hereto presented a notoriously demanding problem due to both the substantial complexity of the gene regulatory networks involved as well as their often characteristically discrete and stochastic dynamics. To address these issues, we have developed an approach that enables automated multiscale abstraction of biological system descriptions based on reaction kinetics. Implemented as a computational tool, this method has allowed us to efficiently analyze the modular organization and behavior of the E. coli fimbriation switch circuit at different temperature settings, thus facilitating new insights into this mode of {UPEC} molecular virulence regulation. In particular, our results suggest that, with respect to its role in shutting down fimbriae expression, the primary function of {FimB} recombinase may be to effect a controlled down-regulation (rather than increase) of the {ON}-to-{OFF} fim switching rate via temperature-dependent suppression of competing dynamics mediated by recombinase {FimE}. Our computational analysis further implies that this down-regulation mechanism could be particularly significant inside the host environment, thus potentially contributing further understanding toward the development of novel therapeutic approaches to {UPEC}-caused {UTIs}.},

Timed circuits are a class of asynchronous circuits that are optimized using explicit timing information. In asynchronous circuits, correct operation requires that there are no hazards in the circuit implementation. Therefore, when designing an asynchronous circuit, each internal node and output of the circuit must be verified for hazard-freedom to ensure correct operation. Current verification algorithms for timed circuits require an explicit state exploration that often results in state explosion for even modest-sized examples. The goal of this paper is to abstract the behavior of internal nodes and utilize this information to make a conservative determination of hazard-freedom for each node in the circuit. Experimental results indicate that this approach is substantially more efficient than existing timing verification tools. These results also indicate that this method scales well for large examples that could not be previously analyzed, in that it is capable of analyzing these circuits in less than a second. While this method is conservative in that some false hazards may be reported, our results indicate that their number is small},

Using {POSET} timing, our synthesis procedure derives a timed circuit that is hazard-free. The circuit uses only basic gates to facilitate the mapping to semi-custom components, such as standard-cells and gate-arrays. The resulting gate-level timed circuit implementations are 30\%-40\% smaller and 30\%-50\% faster than those produced using other asynchronous design methodologies.

	title = {Asynchronous Genetic Design},
	abstract = {Synthetic biology is applying engineering concepts to biological processes to enable genetic circuit designs, among other applications. As more biological parts are being discovered, it is vital to have an automated procedure to allow complex circuit designs to be built. Technology mapping is a set of procedures that maps biological components to a design specification. Current technology mapping frameworks for genetic circuits are used to design combinational circuits. This dissertation illustrates the process of building an automated workflow for a technology mapping framework to design synchronous sequential genetic circuits. An automated process to create a library of gates for logic and memory circuits is described to construct gates from {DNA} parts retrieved from a standardize data repository. Genetic constraints address what parts can be mapped to the design specification when the gates and designs are constructed. The proposed automaton workflow begins with a specification provided in a formal design language, such as Verilog. The input design specification is converted into a genetic regulatory network represented using the Synthetic Biology Open Language ({SBOL}). The network is decomposed into base functions ({NOR} gates, inverters, and genetic toggle switches) and matching and covering algorithms are performed to produce the output design. The output design is converted to the Systems Biology Markup Language ({SBML}) data format for testing and simulation. The outcome of this work provides the synthetic biology community insights on how asynchronous sequential circuit designs can be built through an automated procedure to perform technology mapping from libraries composed of logic gates and memory circuits.},

While synthetic combinational Boolean logic gates have been constructed, there are many open issues in the design of sequential logic gates. One such gate common in most asynchronous circuits is the Muller C-element, which is used to synchronize multiple independent processes. This paper proposes a novel design for a genetic Muller C-element using transcriptional regulatory elements. The design of a genetic Muller C-element enables the construction of virtually any asynchronous circuit from genetic material. There are, however, many issues that complicate designs with genetic materials. These complications result in modifications being required to the normal digital design procedure. This paper presents two designs that are logically equivalent to a Muller C-element. Mathematical analysis and stochastic simulation, however, show that only one functions reliably.},

The format leverages two decades of {SBML} and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models.

	abstract = {This paper presents an efficient method for verifying hazard freedom in timed asynchronous circuits. Timed circuits are a class of asynchronous circuits that utilize explicit timing information for optimization throughout the entire design process. In asynchronous circuits, correct operation requires that there are no hazards in the circuit implementation. Therefore, when designing an asynchronous circuit, each internal node and output of the circuit must be verified for hazard-freedom to ensure correct operation. Current verification algorithms for timed asynchronous circuits require an explicit state exploration often resulting in state explosion for even modest sized examples. The goal of this work is to abstract the behavior of internal nodes and utilize this information to make a conservative determination of hazard-freedom for each node in the circuit. Experimental results indicate that this approach is substantially more efficient than existing timing verification tools. These results also indicate that this method scales well for large examples. It is capable of analyzing circuits in less than a second that could not be previously analyzed. While this method is conservative in that some false hazards may be reported, our results indicate that the number of false hazards is small.},

The failure trace is analyzed, and sufficient timing constraints to prevent the failure is obtained. Then, the delay bounds are tightened according to the timing constraints by using an {ILP} (Integer Linear Programming) solver. This process terminates when either some delay bounds under which no failure is detected are found or no new delay bounds to prevent the failures can be obtained.

	abstract = {Locality principles are becoming paramount in controlling advancement of data through pipelined systems. Achieving fine grained power down and progressive pipeline stalls at the local stage level is therefore becoming increasingly, important to enable lower dynamic power consumption while keeping introduced switching noise under control as well as avoiding global distribution of timing critical stall signals. It has long been known that the interlocking properties of as asynchronous pipelined systems have a potential to provide such benefits. However it has not been understood how such interlocking can be achieved in synchronous pipelines. This paper presents a novel technique based on local clock gating and synchronous handshake protocols that achieves stage level interlocking characteristics in synchronous pipelines similar to that of asynchronous pipelines. The presented technique is directly applicable to traditional synchronous pipelines and works equally well for two-phase clocked pipelines based on transparent latches, as well as one-phase clocked pipelines based on master-slave latches.},

Energy has a polynomial growth with word size, but has a coefficient that is much smaller than that seen in a combinational array design. Although the multiplier is self-timed, it can be embedded in a synchronous system appearing as a combinational element. This paper presents latency, area, and energy estimates for the multiplier implemented at various word sizes, and compares these numbers with a traditional combinational array multiplier.

No currently available minimizers for literal-exact two-level hazard-free logic minimization of extended burst-mode {gC} controllers can handle large circuits without synthesis times ranging up over thousands of seconds. Even existing heuristic approaches take too much time when iterative exploration over a large design space is required and do not yield minimum results.

Our algorithm achieves very fast logic minimization by introducing compacted state graphs and cover tables and an efficient single-cube cover algorithm for single-output minimization. Our exact logic minimizer finds minimal number of literal solutions to all currently available benchmarks, in less than one second on a 333 {MHz} microprocessor-more than three orders of magnitude faster than existing literal exact methods, and over an order of magnitude faster than existing heuristic methods for the largest benchmarks.

This technique uses timed stochastic Petri nets ({TSPN}) which support choice and arbitrary delay distributions. The {SCP} is the delay of the average path in a {TSPN} when represented as a sum of weighted place delays. A place delay is the expected value of its associated distribution and its weight denotes its importance in the average path of the {TSPN}. The approach analyzes finite execution traces of the {TSPN} to derive an expression for the weight values in the {SCP}. The weights can be analyzed with basic statistics to within an arbitrary error bound. This paper demonstrates the use of the {SCP} to aggressively optimize timed asynchronous circuits for improved average-case performance by reducing transistor counts, reordering input pins at gates, and skewing transistor sizes to favor important transitions. Each optimization effort is directed to improve the average-case delay in the circuit at the possible expense of the worst-case delay.},

The synthesis procedure begins with a deterministic graph specification with timing constraints. A timing analysis extracts the timed concurrency and timed causality relations between any two signal transitions. Then, a hazard-free implementation of the specification is synthesized by analyzing precedence graphs which are constructed by using the timed concurrency and timed causality relations. The major result of this work is that the method does not suffer from the state explosion problem, achieves significant reductions in synthesis time, and generates synthesized circuits that have nearly the same area as compared to previous timed circuit methods. In particular, this paper shows that a timed circuit-not containing circuit hazards under given timing constraints-can be found by using the relations between signal transitions of the specification. Moreover, the relations can be efficiently found using a heuristic timing analysis algorithm. By allowing significantly larger designs to be synthesized, this work is a step towards the development of high-level synthesis tools for system level asynchronous circuits.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In order to efficiently analyze a large scale system in an automated and objective manner, abstraction is essential. This paper presents an automated abstraction methodology that systematically reduces the small scale complexity found in genetic regulatory network models, while broadly preserving the large scale system behavior. Our approach is to first reduce the number of reactions through a quasisteady-state approximation-based algorithm. Second, it represents the exact molecular state of the system by a set of reduced Boolean (or nary) discrete levels. This results in a chemical master equation that is approximated by a Markov chain with a much smaller state space providing significant simulation time acceleration and computability gains. 1 Background Numerous methods have been proposed to model genetic regulatory networks [1, 2]. While many traditional approaches have relied on a differential equation representation as inferred from a set of underlying biochemical reactions, there has been a growing appreciation of their limitations [3-6]. In particular, differential equation analysis of genetic networks generally assumes that the number of molecules in a cell is high and their concentrations can be viewed as continuous quantities, while their underlying reactions occur deterministically. However, in natural genetic networks these assumptions frequently do not hold as, for example, {DNA} molecules are typically present in single digit quantities, while some promoters can lead to substantial fluctuations in transcription/translation rates and essentially non-deterministic expression characteristics [7, 8].},

Using a combination of data and resource constraints, as well as an analysis of bounded delay information, our method determines the minimum number of resources and registers needed to implement a given schedule.

	abstract = {This paper presents a technique to estimate the stochastic cycle period ({SCP}), a performance metric for timed asynchronous circuits. This technique uses timed stochastic Petri nets ({TSPN}) which support choice and arbitrary delay distributions. The {SCP} is the delay of the average path in a {TSPN} when represented as a sum of weighted place delays. A place delay is the expected value of its associated distribution and its weight denotes its importance in the average path of the {TSPN}. The approach analyzes finite execution traces of the {TSPN} to derive an expression for the weight values in the {SCP}. The weights can be analyzed with basic statistics to within an arbitrary error bound. This paper demonstrates the use of the {SCP} to aggressively optimize timed asynchronous circuits for improved average-case performance by reducing transistor counts, reordering input pins at gates, and skewing transistor sizes to favor important transitions. Each optimization effort is directed to improve the average-case delay in the circuit at the possible expense of the worst-case delay.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method to synthesize timed asynchronous circuits directly from the specification without generating a state graph. The synthesis procedure begins with a deterministic graph specification with timing constraints. A timing analysis extracts the timed concurrency and timed causality relations between any two signal transitions. Then, a hazard-free implementation of the specification is synthesized by analyzing precedence graphs which are constructed by using the timed concurrency and timed causality relations. The major result of this work is that the method does not suffer from the state explosion problem, achieves significant reductions in synthesis time, and generates synthesized circuits that have nearly the same area as compared to previous timed circuit methods. In particular, this paper shows that a timed circuit-not containing circuit hazards under given timing constraints-can be found by using the relations between signal transitions of the specification. Moreover, the relations can be efficiently found using a heuristic timing analysis algorithm. By allowing significantly larger designs to be synthesized, this work is a step towards the development of high-level synthesis tools for system level asynchronous circuits.},

This paper proposes an efficient method to generate the genetic regulatory network inferred from time series data. Our method first encodes the data into levels. Next, it determines the set of potential parents for each gene based upon the probability of the gene’s expression increasing. After a subset of potential parents are selected, it determines if any genes in this set may have a combined effect. Finally, the potential sets of parents are competed against each other to determine the final set of parents. The result is a directed graph representation of the genetic network’s repression and activation connections. Our results on synthetic data generated from models for several genetic networks with tight feedback are promising. 1},

	title = {Abstracted stochastic analysis of type 1 pili expression in E. coli},
	abstract = {Abstract — With the aid of model abstractions, biochemical networks can be analyzed at different levels of resolution: from low-level quantitative models to high-level qualitative ones. Furthermore, an ability to change the level of abstraction can be very useful when dealing with many biological systems, including gene regulatory networks. These systems typically have too many components and states to be practically studied using all-inclusive low-level models, yet they often manifest enough dynamical and functional complexity, making an entirely high-level qualitative representation similarly inadequate — thus necessitating a search for some intermediate level of abstraction. Finally, while most abstractions used in modeling of biochemical networks have traditionally been performed manually, doing so accurately in a large system is a tedious and time-consuming process that is highly susceptible to errors during model transformation. To address these issues, we have developed a methodology and implemented an automated modeling and analysis tool with variable abstraction level capabilities. In this paper, we use it for the analysis of switching in Type 1 pili expression dynamics and, in particular, for the problem of estimating the effect of H-{NS} and Lrp regulatory protein levels on phase variation rates in E. coli. Such behavior is notoriously difficult to study due to the size of the associated gene regulatory network and the characteristically stochastic dynamics involved, which result in very high analytical and computational demands. Here, we show how, by using our system, we are able to automatically abstract the switch network and accurately predict E. coli afimbriation rates, while, at the same time, accelerating the required computations by up to two orders of magnitude.

By unfolding the cyclic graph specification of an asynchronous circuit into an infinite acyclic graph, it is possible to use efficient algorithms to analyze the given timing constraints. A sufficient condition for the removal of redundancy in the specification is derived. Because of this condition, it is only necessary to analyze a finite subgraph of the infinite acyclic graph for derivation of a correct implementation. A systematic synthesis procedure that further optimizes the implementation based on the timing constraints is applied to the reduced specification. It is shown that the resulting timed implementation can be significantly reduced in complexity from its speed-independent counterpart while remaining hazard-free under the given timing constraints.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Given the substantial computational requirements of stochastic simulation, approximation is essential for efficient analysis of any realistic biochemical system. This paper introduces a new approximation method to reduce the computational cost of stochastic simulations of an enzymatic reaction scheme which in biochemical systems often includes rapidly changing fast reactions with enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex molecules present in very small counts. Our new method removes the substrate dissociation reaction by approximating the passage time of the formation of each enzyme-substrate complex molecule which is destined to a production reaction. This approach skips the firings of unimportant yet expensive reaction events, resulting in a substantial acceleration in the stochastic simulations of enzymatic reactions. Additionally, since all the parameters used in our new approach can be derived by the Michaelis-Menten parameters which can actually be measured from experimental data, applications of this approximation can be practical even without having full knowledge of the underlying enzymatic reaction. Furthermore, since our approach does not require a customized simulation procedure for enzymatic reactions, it allows biochemical systems that include such reactions to still take advantage of standard stochastic simulation tools. Here, we apply this new method to various enzymatic reaction systems, resulting in a speedup of orders of magnitude in temporal behavior analysis without any significant loss in accuracy.},

Previous papers proposed either exact algorithms, which suffer from statespace explosion, or efficient algorithms which use a (conservative) approximation to avoid state-space explosion but can result in the rejection of designs which are valid. In particular, [7] presents a timed extention of the work in [1] which is very efficient but is not able to handle circuits with internal loops, which prevents its use in some cases. We propose a new approach to the problem in order to overcome the mentioned limitations, without sacrificing efficiency. To do so, we first introduce a general framework targeted at the conservative checking of safety failures. This framework is not restricted to the checking of timed asynchronous circuits. Secondly, we propose a new (conservative) semantics for timed circuits, in order to use the proposed framework for hazard checking of such circuits. Using this framework with the proposed semantics yields an efficient algorithm that addresses the limitations of the previous approaches.},

The {VHDL}-{AMS} description is compiled into labeled hybrid Petri nets ({LHPNs}) in which analog values are modeled as continuous variables that can change at rates in a bounded range and digital values are modeled using Boolean signals. The verification method begins by transforming the {LHPN} model into an {SMT} formula composed of the initial state, the transition relation unrolled for a specified number of iterations, and the complement of the assertion in each set of state variables. When this formula evaluates to true, this indicates a violation of the assertion and an error trace is reported. This method has been implemented and preliminary results are promising.},

Our design eliminates potential metastability problems by using a clock generated by a stoppable ring oscillator, which is capable of driving the large clock load found in present day microprocessors. Using the {ATACS} design tool, we designed highly optimized transistor-level circuits to control the ring oscillator and generate the clock and handshake signals with minimal overhead. Our interface architecture requires no redesign of the synchronous circuitry. Incorporating asynchronous modules in a high-speed pipeline improves performance by exploiting data-dependent delay variations. Since the speed of the synchronous circuitry tracks the speed of the ring oscillator under different processes, temperatures, and voltages, the entire chip operates at the speed dictated by the current operating conditions, rather than being governed by the worst case conditions. These two factors together can lead to a significant improvement in average-case performance. The interface design is simulated using the 0.6-/spl mu/m {HP} {CMOS}14B process in {HSPICE}.},

	abstract = {Stochastic chemical kinetics ({SCK}) has become an important formalism for modeling and analysis of complex biological systems as it can capture the discreteness and the randomness of underlying biochemical reactions. One of the assumptions made by {SCK} is that each reaction be an elementary step which cannot be broken down into smaller steps. As such, transition events of the {SCK} model occur spontaneously in that there is no time lag between the reaction initiation and completion. In practice, however, it is very difficult to experimentally determine if an observed state change is a result of an elementary reaction or a sequence of several reaction steps. To test various hypotheses on such time-delays through the use of the {SCK}, all of the intermediate reactions and species need to be explicitly specified, which can quickly become cumbersome. To more efficiently model and analyze potential effects of such intermediate reaction steps, this paper proposes a new formalism for higher-level discrete-stochastic treatment of biological systems with reaction delays. Our new formalism can represent a time delay caused by intermediate reaction steps as an Erlang random variable, allowing a model's size to be reduced substantially. This paper illustrates an application of this formalism for analysis of the effect of different transcription elongation steps and rates on the distribution of {RNA} molecules.},

	abstract = {When designing and analyzing genetic circuits, researchers are often interested in the probability of the system reaching a given state within a certain amount of time. Usually, this involves simulating the system to produce some time series data and analyzing this data to discern the state probabilities. However, as the complexity of models of genetic circuits grow, it becomes more difficult for researchers to reason about the different states by looking only at time series simulation results of the models. To address this problem, this paper employs the use of stochastic model checking, a method for determining the likelihood that certain events occur in a system, with continuous stochastic logic ({CSL}) properties to obtain similar results. This goal is accomplished by the introduction of a methodology for converting a genetic circuit model ({GCM}) into a continuous-time Markov chain ({CTMC}). This {CTMC} is analyzed using transient Markov chain analysis to determine the likelihood that the circuit satisfies a given {CSL} property in a finite amount of time. This paper illustrates a use of this methodology to determine the likelihood of failure in a genetic toggle switch and compares these results to stochastic simulation-based analysis of this same circuit. Our results show that this method results in a substantial speedup as compared with conventional simulation-based approaches.},

However, traditional approaches by statically analyzing system model structures are often not able to reveal enough independence for reduction. To address such a problem, this paper presents a behavioral analysis approach that uses a compositional reachability analysis method to generate the over-approximate local state spaces for all modules in a system where a much more precise independence relation can be extracted for partial order reduction. Compared to the static analysis approaches, significantly higher reduction on complexity can be seen in a number of non-trivial examples, and as a consequence, dramatically less time and memory are required to finish these examples.},

This paper presents approaches of using decision diagrams to represent very large state space compactly and efficiently. This is possible for asynchronous systems as two system states connected by a transition often share many same local portions. Using decision diagrams can significantly reduce memory demand by not using memory to store the redundant information among different states. This paper considers multi-value decision diagrams for this purpose. Additionally, a technique to reduce the runtime overhead of using these diagrams is also described. Experimental results and comparison with the state compression method as implemented in the model checker {SPIN} show that the approaches presented in this paper are memory efficient for storing large state space with acceptable runtime overhead.},

These learned models are then adopted in a hybrid formal reachability analysis framework where the support function based manipulations are developed to efficiently handle the large linear portion of the design and the more general satisfiability modulo theories technique is applied to the remaining nonlinear portion. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated for the locked time verification of a digitally intensive phase locked loop.},

First, the memory required to represent the model can quickly expand in the process. Second, the flattening process is computationally expensive. Finally, when modeling a dynamic cellular population within {iBioSim}, inlining the hierarchy of the model is inefficient since models must grow dynamically over time. This paper discusses a new approach to handle hierarchy on the fly to make the tool faster and more memory-efficient.

They are a critical part of the support for large-scale high-performance digital systems, provide important functionalities in medium-scale embedded and mobile systems, and act as a core organ of autonomous electronics such as sensor nodes. Analog and digital parts are closely inter-mixed, hence demanding {AMS} design methods and tools to be more holistic. In particular, the emergence of “little digital” electronics inside or near analog circuitry calls for the increasing use of asynchronous logic. To cope with the growing complexity of {AMS} designs, formal methods are required to complement traditional simulation approaches.

	abstract = {This book presents outstanding contributions in an exciting, new and multidisciplinary research area: the application of formal, automated reasoning techniques to analyse complex models in systems biology and systems medicine. Automated reasoning is a field of computer science devoted to the development of algorithms that yield trustworthy answers, providing a basis of sound logical reasoning. For example, in the semiconductor industry formal verification is instrumental to ensuring that chip designs are free of defects (or "bugs"). Over the past 15 years, systems biology and systems medicine have been introduced in an attempt to understand the enormous complexity of life from a computational point of view. This has generated a wealth of new knowledge in the form of computational models, whose staggering complexity makes manual analysis methods infeasible. Sound, trusted, and automated means of analysing the models are thus required in order to be able to trust their conclusions. Above all, this is crucial to engineering safe biomedical devices and to reducing our reliance on wet-lab experiments and clinical trials, which will in turn produce lower economic and societal costs. Some examples of the questions addressed here include: Can we automatically adjust medications for patients with multiple chronic conditions? Can we verify that an artificial pancreas system delivers insulin in a way that ensures Type 1 diabetic patients never suffer from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia? And lastly, can we predict what kind of mutations a cancer cell is likely to undergo? This book brings together leading researchers from a number of highly interdisciplinary areas, including: - Parameter inference from time series - Model selection - Network structure identification - Machine learning - Systems medicine - Hypothesis generation from experimental data - Systems biology, systems medicine, and digital pathology - Verification of biomedical devices "This book presents a comprehensive spectrum of model-focused analysis techniques for biological systems ...an essential resource for tracking the developments of a fast moving field that promises to revolutionize biology and medicine by the automated analysis of models and data."

Traditional academic asynchronous designs methods use unbounded delay assumptions, resulting in circuits that are verifiable, but ignore timing for simplicity, leading to unnecessarily conservative designs. In industry, however, timing is critical to reduce both chip area and circuit delay. Due to a lack of formal methods that handle timing information correctly, circuits with timing constraints usually require extensive simulation to gain confidence in the design. This thesis bridges this gap by introducing timed circuits in which explicit timing information is incorporated into the specification and utilized throughout the design procedure to optimize the implementation.

Circuit correctness in these aggressive circuit styles is highly timing dependent, and in industry they are typically designed by hand. In order to automate the process of designing and verifying timed circuits, algorithms to explore the reachable state space of the circuit under the timing constraints are necessary. This thesis presents a new specification method for timed circuits, timed event/level ({TEL}) structures, and new algorithms for exploring a timed state space. The {TEL} structure specification allows the designer to specify behavior controlled by signal transitions, which is best for representing sequencing, and behavior controlled by signal levels, which is best for representing gate level circuits. This thesis also presents algorithms based on partially ordered sets ({POSETs}) that explores the timed state space of the {TEL} structure. Results using the new specification method and algorithms show orders of magnitude improvement over previous techniques in both speed and memory performance. The algorithms have also been successfully applied to several circuit examples from the recently published experimental Gigahertz processor developed at {IBM}. The speed and memory performance improvements of the algorithm allow automatic synthesis and verification of complex timed circuits, making them an attractive design alternative.},

The starting point is a channel-level specification of a design. The goal is a signal-level description of the given design that is correct, synthesizable, and efficient. This dissertation studies the impact of protocol selection and implementation on deadlock avoidance, complete state coding ({CSC}), {CPU} time required to compile a given example, and the quality of the circuit. This dissertation treats reshuffling and state-variable insertion as special cases of concurrency reduction. Prior work in the field has also taken this approach. However, this dissertation extends this approach and applies it to specifications that contain quantitative timing assumptions. The concurrency reduction algorithms have been implemented within a computer aided design ({CAD}) tool. Starting from a signal-level specification that contains the constraints of the desired protocol, these algorithms search the concurrency reduction design space, guided by an estimate of the performance of the final circuit. The {CAD} tool that this dissertation presents also contains a front end that, given a channel-level specification, produces the starting point for concurrency-reduction. This front end currently handles only pure synchronization channels, using one protocol. Finding all possible ways to reduce concurrency of a specification is a fundamentally exponential problem. However, this dissertation presents techniques to dramatically prune the search space. This dissertation demonstrates that these techniques are capable of reducing the search space by several orders of magnitude compared to the theoretical upper bound – and by one order of magnitude beyond existing techniques – without significantly impacting the quality of the solutions.},

	title = {Design Methodology for Analog {VLSI} Implementations of Error Control Decoders},
	abstract = {In order to reach the Shannon limit, researchers have found more efficient error control coding schemes. However, the computational complexity of such error control coding schemes is a barrier to implementing them. Recently, researchers have found that bioinspired analog network decoding is a good approach with better combined power/speed performance than its digital counterparts. However, the lack of {CAD} (computer aided design) tools makes the analog implementation quite time consuming and error prone. Meanwhile, the performance loss due to the nonidealities of the analog circuits has not been systematically analyzed. Also, how to organize analog circuits so that the nonideal effects are minimized has not been discussed. In designing analog error control decoders, simulation is a time-consuming task because the bit error rate is quite low at high {SNR} (signal to noise ratio), requiring a large number of simulations. By using high-level {VHDL} simulations, the simulation is done both accurately and efficiently. Many researchers have found that error control decoders can be interpreted as operations of the sum-product algorithm on probability propagation networks, which is a kind of factor graph. Of course, analog error control decoders can also be described at a high-level using factor graphs. As a result, an automatic simulation tool is built. From its high-level factor graph description, the {VHDL} simulation files for an analog error control decoder can be automatically generated, making the simulation process simple and efficient. After analyzing the factor graph representations of analog error control decoders, we found that analog error control decoders have quite regular structures and can be built by using a small number of basic cells in a cell library, facilitating automatic synthesis. This dissertation also presents the cell library and how to automatically synthesize analog decoders from a factor graph description. All substantial nonideal effects of the analog circuit are also discussed in the dissertation. How to organize the circuit to minimize these effects and make the circuit optimized in a combined consideration of speed, performance, and power is also provided.},

	title = {Correctness and Reduction in Timed Circuit Analysis},
	abstract = {To increase performance, circuit designers are experimenting with timed circuits a class of circuits that rely on a complex set of timing constraints for correct functionality. This is evidenced in published experimental designs from industry. Timing constraints are key to the success of these designs, and algorithms to verify timing constraints are required to make them practical in commercial applications. Due to the complexity of the constraints, however, traditional static timing analysis is not adequate. Timed state space analysis is required; thus, improved timed state space analysis is paramount to producing efficient timed circuits. 
This dissertation discusses two facets of work in timed state space analysis: correctness and reduction. For correctness, this dissertation presents the level ruled Petri net as a model for timed circuits. This model is based on the Petri net language. It includes, however, timing information and level expressions that are key to the specification and verification of timed circuits. This dissertation formalizes the intent of correctness in the verification of a timed circuit by defining a set of failure conditions that can be analyzed in the circuit's respective model. The circuit is said to be correct if its model is failure free. For reduction, this dissertation presents a timed state space analysis algorithm that verifies correctness in the timed circuit model. The algorithm, when compared to existing algorithms, reduces on average the running time and memory footprint of analysis. A partial order reduction is implemented for the algorithm to further reduce its resource usage. This reduction is not supported by the existing algorithms; thus, the new analysis algorithm can be applied to systems that are beyond their capacity. This is demonstrated in verifying industrial designs from {IBM} and Sun Microsystems.},

	abstract = {This dissertation presents an efficient method for technology-mapping of timedasynchronous circuits. Technology-mapping combines the steps of decomposition, partitioning, and matching/covering to implement a synthesized design in a given technology. This work is applied to timed circuits, which are a class of asynchronous circuits that utilize explicit timing information for optimization throughout the entire design process. This work carries the timing constraints down to the circuit implementation level, giving new insight into the detection and elimination of hazards. In asynchronous circuits, correct operation requires that there are no hazards in the circuit implementation. Therefore, each internal node and output of the transformed circuit following decomposition must be verified for hazard-freedom to ensure correct operation. Current verification algorithms require an explicit state exploration often resulting in state explosion for even modest sized examples. The goal of the hazard verification portion of technology-mapping is to abstract the behavior of internal nodes and utilize the reduced state space to make a conservative determination of hazard-freedom for each node in the circuit. The newly annotated circuit is then mapped to an existing library for implementation. This dissertation explores various complexities of libraries used for matching and examines the hazard covering behavior using a variety of gates. Issues such as short-circuit detection and common-input matching are explored in detail, particularly when libraries contain generalized C-elements. The goal of this research is a hazard-free implementation of the synthesized design in a user-provided technology. Experimental results indicate that this new hazard-verification approach is substantially more efficient than existing timing verification tools and that in most cases hazard-free netlists are produced with modest sized libraries.},

	title = {Verification of Analog and Mixed-Signal Circuits Using Symbolic Methods},
	abstract = {With the rapidly increasing complexity of hardware, traditional validation techniques are becoming insufficient. This has led to a substantial interest in the formal verification of digital components. There has been relatively little research, however, into the application of formal verification methods to the analog/mixed-signal domain. Therefore, the overall goal of this work is to provide a system for efficient and meaningful analysis of analog/mixed-signal circuits. This encompasses two major efforts: modeling and symbolic analysis.
The continuous nature of analog circuits requires a modeling method that is capable of representing continuous behavior and the discrete nature of digital circuits requires a modeling method that is capable of representing discrete behavior. This dual requirement necessitates a hybrid model—a model that can simultaneously represent continuous and discrete behavior. This work details the development of a specialized hybrid Petri net model with capabilities similar to hybrid automata. 
Analysis is greatly complicated by the addition of continuous behavior to the model. To help alleviate this, infinite numbers of states are often grouped into equivalence classes represented by symbolic structures. The analysis methods described here represent ranges of continuous variables using groups of inequalities which are then either mapped to Binary Decision Diagram variables so that necessary operations can be performed efficiently, or handed over to an advanced Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver for analysis.
After describing the verification system in detail, experiences applying the techniques to several case studies are described and performance results are provided.},

	title = {Learning Genetic Regulatory Network Connectivity from Time Series Data},
	abstract = {Recent experimental advances facilitate the collection of time series data that indicate which genes in a cell are expressed. This information can be used to understand the genetic regulatory network that generates the data. Typically, Bayesian analysis approaches are applied which neglect the time series nature of the experimental data, have difficulty in determining the direction of causality, and do not perform well on networks with tight feedback.
To address these problems, this dissertation presents an improved method, called the {GeneNet} algorithm, to learn genetic regulatory network connectivity which exploits the time series nature of experimental data to allow for better causal predictions on networks with tight feedback. More specifically, the {GeneNet} algorithm provides several contributions to the area of genetic network discovery. It finds networks with cyclic or tight feedback behavior often missed by other methods as it performs a more local analysis of the data. It provides the researcher with the ability to see the interactions between genes in a genetic network. It guides experimental design by providing feedback to the researcher as to which parts of the network are the most unclear. It is encased in an infrastructure that allows for rapid genetic network model creation and evaluation.
The {GeneNet} algorithm first encodes the data into levels. Next, it determines an initial set of influence vectors for each species based upon the probability of the species’ expression increasing. From this set of influence vectors, it determines if any influence vectors should be merged, representing a combined effect. Finally, influence vectors are competed against each other to obtain the best influence vector. The result is a directed graph representation of the genetic network’s repression and activation connections. Results are reported for several synthetic networks showing significant improvements in both recall and runtime while performing nearly as well or better in precision over a dynamic Bayesian approach.},

	abstract = {With advances in technologies such as high throughput data collection and genome sequencing methods, the Human Genome Project which, among other things, determined the human {DNA} sequence and identified all the genes in human {DNA} was completed at least two years ahead of time. As these technologies are becoming more accurate, efficient, and cost effective and a massive amount of genomic and proteomic data are becoming available at a rapid pace, we are now in the position to face the challenge to understand how these genes coupled with environmental stimuli orchestrate the regulation of cell-level behaviors. However, understanding such complex systems is very expensive and is most likely impractical with wet-lab experiments alone as the amount and the complexity of data substantially increase, requiring the integration of computational methods to make the process more efficient.
To allow for substantial acceleration in computational analysis, this dissertation develops a model abstraction methodology for biochemical systems which systematically performs various model abstractions to reduce the complexity of computational biochemical models. Our methodology is particularly useful for systems with small molecular counts that require the discrete and stochastic representation and thus demand substantial computational requirements. As a case study, this dissertation illustrates the application of individual abstraction methods to such systems. Furthermore, it demonstrates the application of collective abstraction methods at various accuracy levels to temporal behavior analysis of several genetic regulatory networks. This dissertation shows that analysis time of biologically relevant properties of such genetic regulatory networks can be improved from days of work to minutes of work using our methodology while maintaining reasonable accuracy.},

	title = {Efficient Modeling and Verification of Analog/Mixed-Signal Circuits Using Labeled Hybrid Petri Nets},
	abstract = {Analog circuit design is traditionally done by expert designers in an ad hoc manner heavily dependent on simulation. This methodology has worked successfully for many years, but process variation and design complexity are prompting designers to explore new techniques. Formal methods are being used successfully to aid in the complex validation problem for digital circuits. This dissertation presents formal methods for analog and mixed-signal ({AMS}) circuits.
This dissertation describes the development of a formal model, labeled hybrid Petri nets ({LHPNs}), appropriate for the modeling and verification of {AMS} circuits. An {LHPN} is a Petri net variant capable of modeling both continuous and discrete quantities. Creating an {LHPN} model of an {AMS} circuit by hand is a complicated and error prone exercise that requires expert knowledge. This is unacceptable for practical adoption of the {LHPN} model and its associated analysis methods. For this reason, this dissertation introduces an automatic {LHPN} model generation method. The method uses a set of simulation traces and a desired system property to generate an {LHPN} modeling the behavior of the simulation traces. The model generator can also be used to generate abstract Verilog-{AMS} or {VHDL}-{AMS} models suitable for use in system-level simulations. 
Formal verification of a property over the entire state space of an {LHPN} model is complicated by the infinite state of the model. For this reason, the infinite states of the model are grouped into potentially finite groups of equivalent states for verification. Difference bound matrices ({DBMs}), a restricted form of convex polygons, are used to represent these equivalent classes of infinite states. Reachability analysis using {DBMs} is very efficient at the cost of exactness. This dissertation presents algorithms for conservative state space analysis and verification of {LHPNs}.
Finally, these methods are demonstrated on several case studies of {AMS} circuits from both academia and industry. The formal verification methods demonstrate the ability to find bugs missed by standard simulations. The abstract modeling methods show the promise of using automatically generated abstract models by demonstrating up to 40x speedup for some examples.},

	title = {Efficient, Sound Formal Verification for Analog/Mixed-Signal Circuits},
	abstract = {The increasing demand for smaller, more efficient circuits has created a need for both digital and analog designs to scale down. Digital technologies have been successful in meeting this challenge, but analog circuits have lagged behind due to smaller transistor sizes having a disproportionate negative affect. Since many applications require small, low-power analog circuits, the trend has been to take advantage of digital's ability to scale by replacing as much of the analog circuitry as possible with digital counterparts. The results are known as {\textbackslash}emph\{digitally-intensive analog/mixed-signal\} ({AMS}) circuits. Though such circuits have helped the scaling problem, they have further complicated verification. This dissertation improves on techniques for {AMS} property specifications, as well as, develops sound, efficient extensions to formal {AMS} verification methods. With the {\textbackslash}emph\{language for analog/mixed-signal properties\} ({LAMP}), one has a simple intuitive language for specifying {AMS} properties. {LAMP} provides a more procedural method for describing properties that is more straightforward than temporal logic-like languages. However, {LAMP} is still a nascent language and is limited in the types of properties it is capable of describing. This dissertation extends {LAMP} by adding statements to ignore transient periods and be able to reset the property check when the environment conditions change. After specifying a property, one needs to verify that the circuit satisfies the property. An efficient method for formally verifying {AMS} circuits is to use the restricted polyhedral class of {\textbackslash}emph\{zones\}. Zones have simple operations for exploring the reachable state space, but they are only applicable to circuit models that utilize constant rates. To extend zones to more general models, this dissertation provides the theory and implementation needed to soundly handle models with ranges of rates. As a second improvement to the state representation, this dissertation describes how octagons can be adapted to model checking {AMS} circuit models. Though zones have efficient algorithms, it comes at a cost of over-approximating the reachable state space. Octagons have similarly efficient algorithms while adding additional flexibility to reduce the necessary over-approximations. Finally, the full methodology described in this dissertation is demonstrated on two examples. The first example is a switched capacitor integrator that has been studied in the context of transforming the original formal model to use only single rate assignments. Th property of not saturating is written in {LAMP}, the circuit is learned, and the property is checked against a faulty and correct circuit. In addition, it is shown that the zone extension, and its implementation with octagons, recovers all previous conclusions with the switched capacitor integrator without the need to translate the model. In particular, the method applies generally to all the models produced and does not require the soundness check needed by the translational approach to accept positive verification results. As a second example, the full tool flow is demonstrated on a digital C-element that is driven by a pair of {RC} networks, creating an {AMS} circuit. The {RC} networks are chosen so that the inputs to the C-element are ordered. {LAMP} is used to codify this behavior and it is verified that the input signals change in the correct order for the provided {SPICE} simulation traces.},

	title = {{SBOLExplorer}: Data Infrastructure and Data Mining for Genetic Design Repositories},
	abstract = {Biology is a very noisy field. Experiments are difficult to reproduce, the mechanisms behind life are not well understood, and data that we do obtain is difficult to make sense of. Much like traditional engineering fields where engineers draw from a library of reusable parts for their designs, experimental and synthetic biologists have designed biological circuits by drawing from a library of genetic constructs. However, these so-called genetic parts are poorly understood and are therefore limited in their usefulness. Additionally, there are hundreds of thousands of parts and sequences that have been either created or discovered. For my thesis, I filter through this biological noise to provide genetic circuit designers a powerful way to search for and access the genetic parts that are useful to them.

This thesis is focused on creating {SBOLExplorer}, a system that is used to provide intuitive search within the {SynBioHub} genetic design repository. {SynBioHub} integrates genetic construct data from various sources and transforms and stores this data in a standardized data model. By tackling the intricate data mining and data infrastructure problems associated with large-scale semi-structured and noisy data, the search, transformation, and storage of data in genetic design repositories can be enhanced. In particular, this thesis focuses on improving the usability of genetic part repositories’ search capabilities. By clustering {SynBioHub}’s genetic parts into many derived collections, duplicate parts are merged. From there, a graph analysis algorithm is used to rank collections of parts by popularity and usefulness. Finally, data infrastructure challenges relating to indexing, storing, serving, and distributed search are solved. The end goal of {SBOLExplorer} is to integrate these findings into {SynBioHub} and other genetic design repositories’ data representation, search functionality, and data infrastructure.},

	title = {Scalable and Reproducible Modeling and Simulation for Heterogeneous Populations},
	abstract = {Advancements in the systems and synthetic biology fields have proved that biology can be engineered. The development of computer-aided design ({CAD}) tools has contributed to advancements in these fields. Mathematical modeling and simulation methods are important assets of {CAD} tools that are frequently applied to the systems and synthetic biology fields. Modeling and simulation methods are used to understand or predict the behavior of a biological system being studied. However, many modeling efforts in those fields face a reproducibility problem, where many published models are not reproducible. In order to address such issue, standards have been created for the representation of biological models. A major advantage of standards is that they enable model reuse and sharing. The leading standard representation of biological systems is the Systems Biology Markup Language ({SBML}).
The {SBML} standard is used to describe how biological processes affect and modify biological entities in a system. Such standard has been widely used to describe biochemical networks, cell signaling path, and gene regulation, among others. Unfortunately, not all models use {SBML} since there are many biological systems that {SBML} is incapable of representing efficiently, such as heterogeneous cellular populations. This dissertation explores extensions to {SBML} for the efficient representation of large heterogeneous cellular populations and simulation methods that can simulate such complex models efficiently. Since cellular populations are inherently hierarchical, this dissertation proposes an efficient simulator for hierarchical {SBML} models. Since the hierarchical structure is preserved in the proposed simulator, the hierarchical simulator is a perfect fit for handling hybrid models. However, no one has explored the coupling of different modeling formalisms within the same {SBML} model. Hence, this dissertation proposes a methodology that can be used to describe hybrid models. Such methodology is demonstrated by using dynamic flux balance analysis ({DFBA}) models as examples and such models can be successfully exchanged between tools. This dissertation also discusses extensions to the {SBML} data model to support regular structures in the form of arrays. Arrays is well-suited for population models since population models use large regular structures. Another application of arrays is microsimulation of disease models, where a population of individuals with unique characteristics need to be model. With the proposed arrays extension, simulators need to scale in order to handle the increase complexity that the arrays extension introduces. Hence, this dissertation also proposes an efficient simulation method that takes advantages of arrays.},

	abstract = {Synthetic biology, as a field of research, applies electrical engineering, systems biology, and bioinformatics to genetic circuit design. Software tools are leveraged to provide rapid iteration through the design space, and data standards are used to encode and characterize complicated genetic circuit designs.

Unfortunately, the software tools that support this workflow are lacking in some critical features such as combinatorial design and support for an extended range of glyphs. These inadequacies hinder the adoption of data standards, and therefore hurt the reproducibility of experiments and results. Necessary details of experiments are not recorded, and the resulting conclusions are therefore not trusted. {SBOLDesigner}, a sequence-based computer aided design tool, addresses these issues.

	title = {Design and Analysis of Genetic Circuits},
	abstract = {Electronic Design Automation ({EDA}) tools have facilitated the design of ever more complex integrated circuits each year. Synthetic biology would also benefit from the development of Genetic Design Automation ({GDA}) tools. Existing {GDA} tools require biologists to design genetic circuits at the molecular level, roughly equivalent to designing electronic circuits at the layout level. Analysis of these circuits is also performed at this very low level. This thesis presents a first step at developing a {GDA} tool that supports higher levels of abstraction. In particular, this thesis describes the Genetic Circuit Model ({GCM}), a graphical specification language from which molecular descriptions can be synthesized. The {GCM} has several advantages. The input is tightly controlled through the use of an editor, limiting the possibility of user error. The representation of the genetic circuit is much more compact than using the System Biology Markup Language ({SBML}), the standard form for representing genetics circuits. The {GCM} can be automatically translated into {SBML}, allowing {GCM}'s to be easily simulated across multiple different simulators. The {GCM} to {SBML} translation process is targeted in such a way that the resulting output can be easily abstracted to allow for efficient simulation. 
To evaluate and test the {GCM}, this thesis presents a case study of the design of a genetic Muller C-element, a gate often used in asynchronous design. Three different genetic Muller C-elements are designed and analyzed. The utility of the {GCM} is demonstrated as it allows for efficient analysis of the Muller C-elements. The results of the simulations show that logically equivalent circuits can have different behaviors. In particular, a speed independent Muller C-element does not necessary imply that the gate is more robust than a non-speed independent gate. Design principles gathered from the simulations are that dual-rail outputs are essential, high gene count increases robustness, cooperativity greater than one is necessary, repression needs to be strong, and decay rates must be balanced for high robustness and low switching time. One potential application of the genetic Muller C-element is determining when to start the invasion of cancer cells. The two input signals are an environmental signal, and a communication signal. Using these signals, the bacteria colony can correctly reach consensus on when to begin the invasion. One interesting result is that noise is necessary in correctly switching into the invasion state.},

Timed asynchronous systems differ from untimed, speed independent systems in that any change to the system or its timing may dramatically affect the reachable state space. Because frequent state space exploration is time consuming, timing information is used in a variety of ways to postpone or eliminate state space explorations. First, timing information is used to predict the impact of a state signal on the overall system. Second, concurrency information is used to narrow the search space to timing-unique solutions. Third, timing information allows state signal insertion in a timing-sequential, yet noncausal, manner. This permits insertion before input events, an option not readily available in speed-independent systems. Finally, by considering timing, state signal insertion points can be chosen which minimally increase circuit latency.

Locally-clocked modules can be used as synchronous datapath elements in synchronous systems or as asynchronous elements in an asynchronous system. One key element of a locally-clocked module is a stoppable ring oscillator (or stoppable clock). If locally-clocked modules are to be used, their practicality must be quantified. Namely, it must be shown that a reliable and useful stoppable clock can be built. This thesis presents the design and evaluation of a fabricated locally-clocked sequential multiplier. The multiplier is used as a driving example to evaluate local clocks. The design for the stoppable clock is a hybrid of stoppable clocks from previous work. The same gates that make up the critical path of the multiplier are used to make the delay element of the stoppable clock. Although the stoppable clock is meant to track the datapath under a wide range of voltages and temperatures, it is shown that the clock requires tuning to match the critical path sometimes. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to match the critical path exactly. In addition, some temperature and voltage data points cause the cutoff path for the clock to be too slow. This problem is fixed by slowing down the clock. Future designs can focus on speeding up the cutoff path; thus, matching the critical path delay is the only limiting factor on clock frequency. A 20-bit multiplier was fabricated through {MOSIS} using {AMI}’s 0.5 μm process. The multiplier consumes 0.468 mm2 and contains 8190 transistors. With a 5 volt power supply, the multiplier runs at 13.3 {MHz} and consumes 196.6 {mW} of power, while the stoppable clock runs at 174 {MHz}. This thesis presents latency and power measurements for the multiplier and stoppable clock in addition to a detailed analysis of stoppable clocks.

First, the memory required to represent the model can quickly expand in the process. Second, the flattening process is computationally expensive. Finally, when modeling a dynamic cellular population within {iBioSim}, inlining the hierarchy of the model is inefficient since models must grow dynamically over time. This paper discusses a new approach to handle hierarchy on the fly to make the tool faster and more memory-efficient. This approach yields significant performance improvements as compared to the former flat analysis method.},

Because these systems are used in safety-critical situations, even intermittent failures are unacceptable. Formal verification allows for comprehensive validation, but becomes unrealistically complicated for large models. This paper proposes certain transforms to simplify system models without removing any of the details required for verification. These details must be conservative, in that they may not remove any state from the model’s behavior. These transforms have shown this method promising in reducing the complexity of embedded system verification. I.},

	title = {Representing Genetic Networks as Labeled Hybrid Petri Nets for State Space Exploration and Markov Chain Analysis},
	abstract = {This paper presents the bachelor’s thesis of Curtis Kendall Madsen which can be broken down into the following three goals. The first goal of this project is to develop a way to convert genetic networks into logical models. Once this is done, finding the state graph of these nets and performing Markov chain analysis on them can provide researchers with insight into the reachability of the states in the original network. Therefore, the second goal of this project is to develop an automated tool that can perform state space exploration of a logical model, and the third goal is to implement a Markov chain analyzer for the stage graph. For the logical representation of genetic networks, the conversion method uses labeled hybrid Petri nets ({LHPNs}) because they are designed for modeling logic while still allowing for important information required by Markov chain analysis such as transition rates to be included in the model. This conversion method is automated and is integrated into the {iBioSim} program allowing users to transform a Genetic Circuit Model ({GCM}) into an {LHPN} with just a click of a button. Also, {iBioSim} now includes the {LHPN} file type in its file tree so users can view and edit {LHPNs} once conversion is complete. In addition, a method for performing state space exploration on an {LHPN} allows the user to view the state graph using Graphviz’s Dotty tool.},

	title = {Automated Generation of Dynamic Models for Genetic Regulatory Networks},
	abstract = {Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline in which biological  components are assembled to form devices with user-defined functions. As in any engineering discipline, modeling is a big part of the design process, since it helps to predict, control, and debug systems in an efficient manner. Systems biology has always been concerned with dynamic models, and a recent increase in high-throughput of experimental data has made it essential to develop dynamic models that can be used for an iterative learning process in a design/build/test workflow. In this thesis work, an automated model generator is created to automatically generate dynamic models for genetic regulatory networks, implemented in the genetic design automation tool, {iBioSim}. This automated model generator uses parameters stored at an online parts repository and encodes the mathematical models it generates using Systems Biology Markup Language. The automated model generator is then used to model and simulate genetic circuits created with the design environment referred to as Cello. The
simulation of the mathematical models produces a dynamical response prediction of each of the circuits, which is unavailable with steady-state modeling. Some of these dynamical
responses present unexpected behavior. Using the dynamic models generated with the automatic model generator of this work, an analysis of the predicted behaviors yielded insight into the underlying biology phenomena that cause the observed glitching behavior
of these circuits.
The last chapter of this thesis is focused mainly on future enhancements to the automated model generator of this work to produce more accurate and precise models not only for genetic regulatory networks in \textit{Escherichia coli}, but any organism where parametrization
exists as proposed in this thesis work. It also explores different analysis that could be implemented into the automated model generator of this work, in order to expand the assessment done on genetic circuits.},

	abstract = {Data standards are integral for interoperability between software applications, since they provide guidelines for how data can be meaningfully exchanged and in a uniform manner. While standards provide a bridge for applications to share and translate data, they do not guarantee that applications are compatible to perform a data exchange or that any translated data is legal and valid. As such, data passed from pairing applications must be validated to ensure that the data was not transformed or lost in the process of exchanging information. Ideally we would want an exchange between tools that is automatically successful; however, the data translated might not be legal or valid any longer. Therefore, data exchanges between applications need to be evaluated under conditions to ensure that compliance with the standard is met. The proposed research is to develop a compliance methodology that tests compliance of applications against the Synthetic Biology Open Language ({SBOL}) standard. This research aims to provide a robust test suite, a {TestRunner} tool implementing the compliance strategy, and a demonstration of the created methodology.},

	abstract = {Synthetic genetic circuits have a number of exciting potential applications such as cleaning up toxic waste, hunting and killing tumor cells, and producing drugs and bio-fuels more efficiently. When designing and analyzing genetic circuits, researchers are often interested in the probability of observing certain behaviors. Discerning these probabilities typically involves simulating the circuit to produce some time series data and computing statistics over the resulting data. However, for very rare behaviors of complex genetic circuits, it becomes computationally intractable to obtain good results as the number of required simulation runs grows exponentially. It is, therefore, necessary to apply numerical methods to determine these probabilities directly. This article describes how stochastic model checking, a method for determining the likelihood that certain events occur in a system, can by applied to models of genetic circuits by translating them into continuous-time Markov chains ({CTMCs}) and analyzing them using Markov chain analysis to check continuous stochastic logic ({CSL}) properties. The utility of this approach is demonstrated with several case studies illustrating how this method can be used to perform design space exploration of two genetic oscillators and two genetic state-holding elements. Our results show that this method results in a substantial speedup as compared with conventional simulation-based approaches.},

	abstract = {This document describes an improved method of formal verification of complex analog/mixed-signal ({AMS}) circuits. Currently, in our {LEMA} tool, verification properties are encoded using labeled Petri net ({LPN}). These {LPNs} are generated manually, a tedious process that requires the user to have considerable familiarity with the tool. To eliminate this time-consuming process, our {LEMA} tool is extended to include a translator that converts properties written in a property specification language to {LPNs}. New methods are also implemented to separate the transient period from the stable output period, thus improving the generated model. Also, the current methodology generates the circuit models for the input values used during the simulation of the circuit. So, models generated for other control input values are not accurate. In this case, accuracy of the generated models is improved by using a linear abstraction method like interpolation.},

	title = {Stochastic Analysis of Synthetic Genetic Circuits},
	url = {https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=196113},
	abstract = {Over the past few decades, synthetic biology has generated great interest to biologists and engineers alike. Synthetic biology combines the research of biology with the engineering principles of standards, abstraction, and automated construction with the ultimate goal of being able to design and build useful biological systems. To realize this goal, researchers are actively working on better ways to model and analyze synthetic genetic circuits, groupings of genes that influence the expression of each other through the use of proteins. When designing and analyzing genetic circuits, researchers are often interested in building circuits that exhibit a particular behavior. Usually, this involves simulating their models to produce some time series data and analyzing this data to discern whether or not the circuit behaves appropriately. This method becomes less attractive as circuits grow in complexity because it becomes very time consuming to generate a sufficient amount of runs for analysis. In addition, trying to select representative runs out of a large data set is tedious and error-prone thereby motivating methods of automating this analysis. This has led to the need for design space exploration techniques that allow synthetic biologists to easily explore the effect of varying parameters and efficiently consider alternative designs of their systems. This dissertation attempts to address this need by proposing new analysis and verification techniques for synthetic genetic circuits. In particular, it applies formal methods such as model checking techniques to models of genetic circuits in order to ensure that they behave correctly and are as robust as possible for a variety of different inputs and/or parameter settings. However, model checking stochastic systems is not as simple as model checking deterministic systems where it is always known what the next state of the system will be at any given step. Stochastic systems can exhibit a variety of different behaviors that are chosen randomly with different probabilities at each time step. Therefore, model checking a stochastic system involves calculating the probability that the system will exhibit a desired behavior. Although it is often more difficult to work with the probabilities that stochastic systems introduce, stochastic systems and the models that represent them are becoming commonplace in many disciplines including electronic circuit design where as parts are being made smaller and smaller, they are becoming less reliable. In addition to stochastic model checking, this dissertation proposes a new incremental stochastic simulation algorithm ({iSSA}) based on Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm ({SSA}) that is capable of presenting a researcher with a simulation trace of the typical behavior of the system. Before the development of this algorithm, discerning this information was extremely error-prone as it involved performing many simulations and attempting to wade through the massive amounts of data. This algorithm greatly aids researchers in designing genetic circuits as it efficiently shows the researcher the most likely behavior of the circuit. Both the {iSSA} and stochastic model checking can be used in concert to give a researcher the likelihood that the system will exhibit its most typical behavior. Once the typical behavior is known, properties for nontypical behaviors can be constructed and their likelihoods can also be computed. This methodology is applied to several genetic circuits leading to new understanding of the effects of various parameters on the behavior of these circuits.},

	title = {Verification methodologies for fault-tolerant network-on-chip systems},
	url = {https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=197657},
	abstract = {Over the last decade, cyber-physical systems ({CPSs}) have seen significant applications in many safety-critical areas, such as autonomous automotive systems, automatic pilot avionics, wireless sensor networks, etc. A Cps uses networked embedded computers to monitor and control physical processes. The motivating example for this dissertation is the use of fault- tolerant routing protocol for a Network-on-Chip ({NoC}) architecture that connects electronic control units (Ecus) to regulate sensors and actuators in a vehicle. With a network allowing Ecus to communicate with each other, it is possible for them to share processing power to improve performance. In addition, networked Ecus enable flexible mapping to physical processes (e.g., sensors, actuators), which increases resilience to Ecu failures by reassigning physical processes to spare Ecus. For the on-chip routing protocol, the ability to tolerate network faults is important for hardware reconfiguration to maintain the normal operation of a system. Adding a fault-tolerance feature in a routing protocol, however, increases its design complexity, making it prone to many functional problems. Formal verification techniques are therefore needed to verify its correctness. This dissertation proposes a link-fault-tolerant, multiflit wormhole routing algorithm, and its formal modeling and verification using two different methodologies. An improvement upon the previously published fault-tolerant routing algorithm, a link-fault routing algorithm is proposed to relax the unrealistic node-fault assumptions of these algorithms, while avoiding deadlock conservatively by appropriately dropping network packets. This routing algorithm, together with its routing architecture, is then modeled in a process-algebra language {LNT}, and compositional verification techniques are used to verify its key functional properties. As a comparison, it is modeled using channel-level {VHDL} which is compiled to labeled Petri-nets ({LPNs}). Algorithms for a partial order reduction method on {LPNs} are given. An optimal result is obtained from heuristics that trace back on {LPNs} to find causally related enabled predecessor transitions. Key observations are made from the comparison between these two verification methodologies.},

	abstract = {Synthetic biology is a new field in which engineers, biologists, and chemists are working together to transform genetic engineering into an advanced engineering discipline, one in which the design and construction of novel genetic circuits are made possible through the application of engineering principles. This dissertation explores two engineering strategies to address the challenges of working with genetic technology, namely the development of standards for describing genetic components and circuits at separate yet connected levels of detail and the use of Genetic Design Automation ({GDA}) software tools to simplify and speed up the process of optimally designing genetic circuits. Its contributions to the field of synthetic biology include (1) a proposal for the next version of the Synthetic Biology Open Language ({SBOL}), an existing standard for specifying and exchanging genetic designs electronically, and (2) a {GDA} work ow that enables users of the software tool {iBioSim} to create an abstract functional specication, automatically select genetic components that satisfy the specication from a design library, and compose the selected components into a standardized genetic circuit design for subsequent analysis and physical construction. Ultimately, this dissertation demonstrates how existing techniques and concepts from electrical and computer engineering can be adapted to overcome the challenges of genetic design and is an example of what is possible when working with publicly available standards for genetic design.},
