	abstract = {{\textless}span class="jp-italic"{\textgreater}Azotobacter vinelandii{\textless}/span{\textgreater} has been studied for over 100 years since its discovery as an aerobic nitrogen-fixing organism. This species has proved useful for the study of many different biological systems, including enzyme kinetics and the genetic code. It has been especially useful in working out the structures and mechanisms of different nitrogenase enzymes, how they can function in oxic environments and the interactions of nitrogen fixation with other aspects of metabolism. Interest in studying {\textless}span class="jp-italic"{\textgreater}A. vinelandii{\textless}/span{\textgreater} has waned in recent decades, but this bacterium still possesses great potential for new discoveries in many fields and commercial applications. The species is of interest for research because of its genetic pliability and natural competence. Its features of particular interest to industry are its ability to produce multiple valuable polymers – bioplastic and alginate in particular; its nitrogen-fixing prowess, which could reduce the need for synthetic fertilizer in agriculture and industrial fermentations, via coculture; its production of potentially useful enzymes and metabolic pathways; and even its biofuel production abilities. This review summarizes the history and potential for future research using this versatile microbe.,},

	abstract = {Nitrogen fixation is advantageous in microbial competition when bioavailable nitrogen is scarce, but has substantial costs for growth rate and growth efficiency. To quantify these costs, we have developed a model of a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that constrains mass, electron and energy flow at the scale of the individual. When tested and calibrated with laboratory data for the soil bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii, the model reveals that the direct energetic cost of nitrogen fixation is small relative to the cost of managing intracellular oxygen. It quantifies the costs and benefits of several potential oxygen protection mechanisms present in nature including enhanced respiration (respiratory protection) as well as the production of extracellular polymers as a barrier to O2 diffusion, and increasing cell size. The latter mechanisms lead to higher growth efficiencies relative to respiratory protection alone. This simple, yet mechanistic framework provides a quantitative model of nitrogen fixation, which can be applied in ecological simulations.},

	abstract = {The birth of plastids brought photosynthesis to eukaryotes and had a huge impact on their evolution. Despite its importance, details of the plastid acquisition process through primary endosymbiosis are not well understood. Recently, a cercozoan testate amoeba, Paulinella chromatophora, has received considerable attention because it may be able to provide insights into the transition from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont to a photosynthetic organelle 1, 2, 3. The P. chromatophora cell contains two chromatophores that look like cylindrical cyanobacteria 4, 5, and it has been debated whether these chromatophores are endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or photosynthetic organelles 4, 5, 6, 7. The chromatophore genome of P. chromatophora strain M0880/a was recently sequenced, revealing that its size (∼1 Mbp) has been reduced and that it lacks several genes important to cyanobacteria, including a few photosynthetic genes [3]. Here, we obtained concrete evidence that psaE, one of the photosynthetic genes, is expressed from the nuclear genome of P. chromatophora. This indicates that the psaE gene has been transferred into the nuclear genome from the chromatophore. Thus, another primary endosymbiotic acquisition of a photosynthetic organelle is under way.},
