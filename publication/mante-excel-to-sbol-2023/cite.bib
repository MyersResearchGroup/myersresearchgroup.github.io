 abstract = { Standards support synthetic biology research by enabling the exchange of component information. However, using formal representations, such as the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), typically requires either a thorough understanding of these standards or a suite of tools developed in concurrence with the ontologies. Since these tools may be a barrier for use by many practitioners, the Excel–SBOL Converter was developed to facilitate the use of SBOL and integration into existing workflows. The converter consists of two Python libraries: one that converts Excel templates to SBOL and another that converts SBOL to an Excel workbook. Both libraries can be used either directly or via a SynBioHub plugin. },
