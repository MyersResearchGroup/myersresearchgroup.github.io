 abstract = {This paper proposes a behavioral synthesis system for asynchronous circuits with bundled-data implementation. The proposed system is based on a behavioral synthesis method for synchronous circuits and extended on operation scheduling and control synthesis for bundled-data implementation. The proposed system synthesizes an RTL model and a simulation model from a behavioral description specified by a restricted C language, a resource library, and a set of design constraints. This paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of area and latency through comparisons among bundled-data implementations synthesized by the proposed system, synchronous counterparts, and bundled-data implementations synthesized by using a behavioral synthesis method for synchronous circuits directly.},
