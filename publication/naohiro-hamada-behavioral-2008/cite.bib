 abstract = {This paper presents a behavioral synthesis method for asynchronous circuits with bundled-data implementation. This paper extends a behavioral synthesis method for synchronous circuits so that an RTL model of bundled-data implementation is synthesized from a behavioral description specified by a restricted C language. Finally, this paper evaluates our method for several benchmarks through a tool implementation.},
