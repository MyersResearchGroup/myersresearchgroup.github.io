 abstract = {This work focuses on determining if there are differences in predicted circuit failure percentages for three different circuit layouts with identical expected functions, using stochastic analysis to simulate different noise sources. The results shed light on the difference between the intrinsic and extrinsic noise model predictions and if the differences in circuit layouts have any effect on glitch propensities. This, in turn, emphasizes the need to evaluate further the relative influence of intrinsic and extrinsic noise on a genetic circuit's output to help designers predict circuit failures more accurately and, therefore, determine better design choices. Moreover, the percent failure predictions between different circuit layouts can help designers weigh different options of circuit topologies to determine which one is best suited for the intended purposes of the design.},
