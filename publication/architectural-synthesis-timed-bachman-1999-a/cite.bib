 abstract = {Describes a new method for the architectural synthesis of timed asynchronous systems. Due to the variable delays associated with asynchronous resources, implicit schedules are created by the addition of supplementary constraints between resources. Since the number of schedules grows exponentially with respect to the size of the given data flow graph, pruning techniques are introduced which dramatically improve the run-time without significantly affecting the quality of the results. Using a combination of data and resource constraints, as well as an analysis of bounded delay information, our method determines the minimum number of resources and registers needed to implement a given schedule. Results are demonstrated using some high-level synthesis benchmark circuits and an industrial example.},
