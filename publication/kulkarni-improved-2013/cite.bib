 abstract = {This document describes an improved method of formal verification of complex analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. Currently, in our LEMA tool, verification properties are encoded using labeled Petri net (LPN). These LPNs are generated manually, a tedious process that requires the user to have considerable familiarity with the tool. To eliminate this time-consuming process, our LEMA tool is extended to include a translator that converts properties written in a property specification language to LPNs. New methods are also implemented to separate the transient period from the stable output period, thus improving the generated model. Also, the current methodology generates the circuit models for the input values used during the simulation of the circuit. So, models generated for other control input values are not accurate. In this case, accuracy of the generated models is improved by using a linear abstraction method like interpolation.},
