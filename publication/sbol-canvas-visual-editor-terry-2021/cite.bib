 abstract = {SBOLCanvas is a web-based application that can create and edit genetic constructs using the SBOL data and visual standards. SBOLCanvas allows a user to create a genetic design visually and structurally from start to finish. It also allows users to incorporate existing SBOL data from a SynBioHub repository. By the nature of being a web-based application, SBOLCanvas is readily accessible and easy to use. A live version of the latest release can be found at https://sbolcanvas.org.},
