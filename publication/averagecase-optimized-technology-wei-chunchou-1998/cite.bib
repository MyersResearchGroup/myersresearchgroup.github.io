 abstract = {This paper presents a technology mapping technique for optimizing the average-case delay of asynchronous combinational circuits implemented using domino logic and one-hot encoded outputs. The technique minimizes the critical path for common input patterns at the possible expense of making less common critical paths longer. To demonstrate the application of this technique, we present a case study of a combinational length decoding block, an integral component of an Asynchronous Instruction Length Decoder (AILD) which can be used in Pentium(R) processors. The experimental results demonstrate that the average-case delay of our mapped circuits can be dramatically lower than the worst-case delay of the circuits obtained using conventional worst-case mapping techniques.},
