 abstract = {A method is presented for analog soft-decision decoding of block product codes (block turbo codes). Extrinsic information is exchanged as analog signals between component row and column decoders. The component MAP decoders use low-power analog computation in subthreshold CMOS circuits to implement the sum-product algorithm. An example decoder design is presented for a (16, 11)/sup 2/ Hamming code.},
