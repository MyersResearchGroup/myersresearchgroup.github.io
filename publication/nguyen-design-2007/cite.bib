 abstract = {Synthetic biology uses engineering principles to design circuits out of genetic materials that are inserted into bacteria to perform various tasks. While synthetic combinational Boolean logic gates have been constructed, there are many open issues in the design of sequential logic gates. One such gate common in most asynchronous circuits is the Muller C-element, which is used to synchronize multiple independent processes. This paper proposes a novel design for a genetic Muller C-element using transcriptional regulatory elements. The design of a genetic Muller C-element enables the construction of virtually any asynchronous circuit from genetic material. There are, however, many issues that complicate designs with genetic materials. These complications result in modifications being required to the normal digital design procedure. This paper presents two designs that are logically equivalent to a Muller C-element. Mathematical analysis and stochastic simulation, however, show that only one functions reliably.},
