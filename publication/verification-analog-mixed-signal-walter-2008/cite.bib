 abstract = {This paper presents two symbolic model checking algorithms for the verification of analog/mixed-signal circuits. The first model checker utilizes binary decision diagrams while the second is a bounded model checker that uses a satisfiability modulo theory solver. Both methods have been implemented, and preliminary results are promising.},
