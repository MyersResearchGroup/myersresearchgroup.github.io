 abstract = { Over the past 2 decades, synthetic biology has yielded ever more complex genetic circuits that are able to perform sophisticated functions in response to specific signals. Yet, genetic circuits are not immediately transferable to an outside-the-lab setting where their performance is highly compromised. We propose introducing a broader test step to the design–build–test–learn workflow to include factors that might contribute to unexpected genetic circuit performance. As a proof of concept, we have designed and evaluated a genetic circuit in various temperatures, inducer concentrations, nonsterilized soil exposure, and bacterial growth stages. We determined that the circuit’s performance is dramatically altered when these factors differ from the optimal lab conditions. We observed significant changes in the time for signal detection as well as signal intensity when the genetic circuit was tested under nonoptimal lab conditions. As a learning effort, we then proceeded to generate model predictions in untested conditions, which is currently lacking in synthetic biology application design. Furthermore, broader test and learn steps uncovered a negative correlation between the time it takes for a gate to turn ON and the bacterial growth phases. As the synthetic biology discipline transitions from proof-of-concept genetic programs to appropriate and safe application implementations, more emphasis on test and learn steps (i.e., characterizing parts and circuits for a broad range of conditions) will provide missing insights on genetic circuit behavior outside the lab. },
