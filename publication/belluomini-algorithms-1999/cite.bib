 abstract = {In order to increase performance, circuit designers are beginning to move away from traditional, synchronous designs based on static logic. Recent design examples have shown that significant performance gains are realized when aggressive circuit styles are used. Circuit correctness in these aggressive circuit styles is highly timing dependent, and in industry they are typically designed by hand. In order to automate the process of designing and verifying timed circuits, algorithms to explore the reachable state space of the circuit under the timing constraints are necessary. This thesis presents a new specification method for timed circuits, timed event/level (TEL) structures, and new algorithms for exploring a timed state space. The TEL structure specification allows the designer to specify behavior controlled by signal transitions, which is best for representing sequencing, and behavior controlled by signal levels, which is best for representing gate level circuits. This thesis also presents algorithms based on partially ordered sets (POSETs) that explores the timed state space of the TEL structure. Results using the new specification method and algorithms show orders of magnitude improvement over previous techniques in both speed and memory performance. The algorithms have also been successfully applied to several circuit examples from the recently published experimental Gigahertz processor developed at IBM. The speed and memory performance improvements of the algorithm allow automatic synthesis and verification of complex timed circuits, making them an attractive design alternative.},
