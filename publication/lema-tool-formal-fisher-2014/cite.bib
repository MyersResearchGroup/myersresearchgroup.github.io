 abstract = {The increasing integration of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits into system designs has further complicated an already difficult verification problem. Recently, formal verification, which has been successful in the purely digital domain, has made some in-roads in the AMS domain. This paper describes one such formal verification tool for AMS circuits, LEMA. In particular, LEMA is capable of generating a formal model from simulation traces that, when coupled with a formal property provided in our new property language, can be model checked with one of three model checkers within LEMA. This paper briefly describes the capabilities of the LEMA AMS verification tool flow.},
