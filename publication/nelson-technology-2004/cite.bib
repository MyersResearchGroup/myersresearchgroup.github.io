 abstract = {This dissertation presents an efficient method for technology-mapping of timed asynchronous circuits. Technology-mapping combines the steps of decomposition, partitioning, and matching/covering to implement a synthesized design in a given technology. This work is applied to timed circuits, which are a class of asynchronous circuits that utilize explicit timing information for optimization throughout the entire design process. This work carries the timing constraints down to the circuit implementation level, giving new insight into the detection and elimination of hazards. In asynchronous circuits, correct operation requires that there are no hazards in the circuit implementation. Therefore, each internal node and output of the transformed circuit following decomposition must be verified for hazard-freedom to ensure correct operation. Current verification algorithms require an explicit state exploration often resulting in state explosion for even modest sized examples. The goal of the hazard verification portion of technology-mapping is to abstract the behavior of internal nodes and utilize the reduced state space to make a conservative determination of hazard-freedom for each node in the circuit. The newly annotated circuit is then mapped to an existing library for implementation. This dissertation explores various complexities of libraries used for matching and examines the hazard covering behavior using a variety of gates. Issues such as short-circuit detection and common-input matching are explored in detail, particularly when libraries contain generalized C-elements. The goal of this research is a hazard-free implementation of the synthesized design in a user-provided technology. Experimental results indicate that this new hazard-verification approach is substantially more efficient than existing timing verification tools and that in most cases hazard-free netlists are produced with modest sized libraries.},
