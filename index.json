Krieger\u0026rsquo;s work enabled ATACS to efficiently add context variables to complete the state coding of a system, thereby removing ambiguity. This work allowed for the insertion of the minimum number of context variables by carefully choosing where to insert the variables and their transitions.\nAfter graduation, Chris worked at Hewlett-Packard and Intel in their microprocessor design labs. He developed EDA tools for server microprocessors and worked as a microprocessor performance architect. Over his career, he worked on two HP PA-RISC® processors (8700/8800), 5 Itanium® processors, 1 Xeon® processor and 1 Atom® processor.\nChris returned to school and completed a PhD program in Computer Science at Colorado State University. His advisor was Dr. Michelle Strout. For his dissertation, Krieger researched a new programming language abstraction, called a loop chain. By identifying a group of loops as a loop chain, compilers and runtime optimizers can perform a variety of code and data transformations to improve locality (e.g. full sparse tiling), concurrency (shared memory autoparallelization), or arithmetic intensity (improved vectorization).\nDr. Krieger is now a lead researcher in the Advanced Computing Systems group at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences on the University of Maryland campus.

In particular, many parts used in synthetic biology come from or are initially tested in a simple bacteria, E. coli, but many potential applications in energy, agriculture, materials, and health require either different bacteria or higher level organisms (yeast for example). Currently, researchers use a trial-and-error approach because they cannot find reliable information about prior experiments with a given part of interest. This process simply cannot scale. Therefore, to achieve scale, a wide range of data must be harnessed to allow confidence to be determined about the likelihood of success. The quantity of data and the exponential increase in the publications generated by this field is creating a tipping point, but this data is not readily accessible to practitioners. To address this challenge, our multidisciplinary team of biological engineers, machine learning experts, data scientists, library scientists, and social scientists will build a knowledge system integrating disparate data and publication repositories in order to deliver effective and efficient access to collectively available information; doing so will enable expedited, knowledge-based synthetic biology design research.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b728e5fe1ef2212051872d1b5fed76c2","permalink":"/author/synthetic-biology-knowledge-system/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/synthetic-biology-knowledge-system/","section":"authors","summary":"The scientific challenge for this project is to accelerate discovery and exploration of the synthetic biology design space.

Automated reasoning is a field of computer science devoted to the development of algorithms that yield trustworthy answers, providing a basis of sound logical reasoning. For example, in the semiconductor industry formal verification is instrumental to ensuring that chip designs are free of defects (or “bugs”). Over the past 15 years, systems biology and systems medicine have been introduced in an attempt to understand the enormous complexity of life from a computational point of view. This has generated a wealth of new knowledge in the form of computational models, whose staggering complexity makes manual analysis methods infeasible. Sound, trusted, and automated means of analysing the models are thus required in order to be able to trust their conclusions. Above all, this is crucial to engineering safe biomedical devices and to reducing our reliance on wet-lab experiments and clinical trials, which will in turn produce lower economic and societal costs. Some examples of the questions addressed here include: Can we automatically adjust medications for patients with multiple chronic conditions? Can we verify that an artificial pancreas system delivers insulin in a way that ensures Type 1 diabetic patients never suffer from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia? And lastly, can we predict what kind of mutations a cancer cell is likely to undergo? This book brings together leading researchers from a number of highly interdisciplinary areas, including: · Parameter inference from time series · Model selection · Network structure identification · Machine learning · Systems medicine · Hypothesis generation from experimental data · Systems biology, systems medicine, and digital pathology · Verification of biomedical devices “This book presents a comprehensive spectrum of model-focused analysis techniques for biological systems ...an essential resource for tracking the developments of a fast moving field that promises to revolutionize biology and medicine by the automated analysis of models and data.”Prof Luca Cardelli FRS, University of Oxford","tags":["\"Search\"","\"stochastic logic\""],"title":"Approximation techniques for stochastic analysis of biological systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris J.
