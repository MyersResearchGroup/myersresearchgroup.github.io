These glitches can have drastic effects if the output of the circuit causes irreversible changes within or with other cells such as a cascade of responses, apoptosis, or the release of a pharmaceutical in an off-target tissue. Therefore, avoiding unwanted variation of a circuit's output can be crucial for the safe operation of a genetic circuit. This paper investigates what causes unwanted switching variations in combinational genetic circuits using hazard analysis and a new dynamic model generator. The analysis is done in previously built and modeled genetic circuits with known glitching behavior. The dynamic models generated not only predict the same steady states as previous models but can also predict the unwanted switching variations that have been observed experimentally. Multiple input changes may cause glitches due to propagation delays within the circuit. Modifying the circuit's layout to alter these delays may change the likelihood of certain glitches, but it cannot eliminate the possibility that the glitch may occur. In other words, function hazards cannot be eliminated. Instead, they must be avoided by restricting the allowed input changes to the system. Logic hazards, on the other hand, can be avoided using hazard-free logic synthesis. This paper demonstrates this by showing how a circuit designed using a popular genetic design automation tool can be redesigned to eliminate logic hazards.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic Circuit Dynamics: Hazard and Glitch Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarah M Keating","Dagmar Waltemath","Matthias König","Fengkai Zhang","Andreas Dräger","Claudine Chaouiya","Frank T Bergmann","Andrew Finney","Colin S Gillespie","Tomáš Helikar","Stefan Hoops","Rahuman S Malik-Sheriff","Stuart L Moodie","Ion I Moraru","Chris J Myers","Aurélien Naldi","Brett G Olivier","Sven Sahle","James C Schaff","Lucian P Smith","Maciej J Swat","Denis Thieffry","Leandro Watanabe","Darren J Wilkinson","Michael L Blinov","Kimberly Begley","James R Faeder","Harold F Gómez","Thomas M Hamm","Yuichiro Inagaki","Wolfram Liebermeister","Allyson L Lister","Daniel Lucio","Eric Mjolsness","Carole J Proctor","Karthik Raman","Nicolas Rodriguez","Clifford A Shaffer","Bruce E Shapiro","Joerg Stelling","Neil Swainston","Naoki Tanimura","John Wagner","Martin Meier-Schellersheim","Herbert M Sauro","Bernhard Palsson","Hamid Bolouri","Hiroaki Kitano","Akira Funahashi","Henning Hermjakob","John C Doyle","Michael Hucka","SBML Level 3 Community members"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236539,"objectID":"378efb89570edb20a10bd1f9bca46bcb","permalink":"/publication/sbml-level-extensible-keating-2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:38.899813Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sbml-level-extensible-keating-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Systems biology has experienced dramatic growth in the number, size, and complexity of computational models.

Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction-based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types including constraint-based models, reaction-diffusion models, logical network models, and rule-based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution.","tags":["\"computational modeling\"","\"file format\"","\"interoperability\"","\"reproducibility\"","\"systems biology\""],"title":"SBML Level 3: An Extensible Format for the Exchange and Reuse of Biological Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucian P.

The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology, following an open community process involving both wet bench scientists and dry scientific modelers and software developers, across academia, industry, and other institutions. This document describes SBOL 3.0.0, which condenses and simplifies previous versions of SBOL based on experiences in deployment across a variety of scientific and industrial settings. In particular, SBOL 3.0.0, (1) separates sequence features from part/sub-part relationships, (2) renames Component Definition/Component to Component/Sub-Component, (3) merges Component and Module classes, (4) ensures consistency between data model and ontology terms, (5) extends the means to define and reference Sub-Components, (6) refines requirements on object URIs, (7) enables graph-based serialization, (8) moves Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) for Component types, (9) makes all sequence associations explicit, (10) makes interfaces explicit, (11) generalizes Sequence Constraints into a general structural Constraint class, and (12) expands the set of allowed constraints.","tags":[],"title":"Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) Version 3.0.0","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Baig","Pedro Fontanarrosa","Vishwesh Kulkarni","James McLaughlin","Prashant Vaidyanathan","Bryan Bartley","Swapnil Bhatia","Shyam Bhakta","Michael Bissell","Kevin Clancy","Robert Sidney Cox","Angel Goñi Moreno","Thomas Gorochowski","Raik Grunberg","Augustin Luna","Curtis Madsen","Goksel Misirli","Tramy Nguyen","Nicolas Le Novere","Zachary Palchick","Matthew Pocock","Nicholas Roehner","Herbert Sauro","James Scott-Brown","John T.

As in any engineering discipline, modeling is a big part of the design process, since it helps to predict, control, and debug systems in an efficient manner. Systems biology has always been concerned with dynamic models, and a recent increase in high-throughput of experimental data has made it essential to develop dynamic models that can be used for an iterative learning process in a design/build/test workflow. In this thesis work, an automated model generator is created to automatically generate dynamic models for genetic regulatory networks, implemented in the genetic design automation tool, iBioSim. This automated model generator uses parameters stored at an online parts repository and encodes the mathematical models it generates using Systems Biology Markup Language. The automated model generator is then used to model and simulate genetic circuits created with the design environment referred to as Cello. The simulation of the mathematical models produces a dynamical response prediction of each of the circuits, which is unavailable with steady-state modeling. Some of these dynamical responses present unexpected behavior. Using the dynamic models generated with the automatic model generator of this work, an analysis of the predicted behaviors yielded insight into the underlying biology phenomena that cause the observed glitching behavior of these circuits. The last chapter of this thesis is focused mainly on future enhancements to the automated model generator of this work to produce more accurate and precise models not only for genetic regulatory networks in emphEscherichia coli, but any organism where parametrization exists as proposed in this thesis work. It also explores different analysis that could be implemented into the automated model generator of this work, in order to expand the assessment done on genetic circuits.","tags":[],"title":"Automated Generation of Dynamic Models for Genetic Regulatory Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zach Zundel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236521,"objectID":"80989c1d482b9119e66b25bee1b2c743","permalink":"/publication/improving-authentication-authorization-zundel-2019/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:21.488924Z","relpermalink":"/publication/improving-authentication-authorization-zundel-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthetic Biology is an emerging discipline which uses engineering principles to shape biological behavior. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a standard for describing biological constructs which enables engineering workflows that previous formats, such as GenBank and FASTA, could not. SynBioHub is an online repository for storing and sharing genetic designs. It uses the SBOL standard and an RDF triplestore to store designs, as well as supporting file attachment and external links. Several research efforts in synthetic biology have adopted SynBioHub and SBOL. These research efforts have revealed key areas for improvement in SynBioHub. Improving user sharing and permissioning is a primary target for improvement. The existing system has basic support for sharing with different privilege levels. Unfortunately, its architecture makes it difficult to extend and improve. Due to this difficulty, many features which would make SynBioHub more collaborative have not been implemented. This work aims to make synthetic biology more collaborative by providing a better foundation for experimentation and innovation in user sharing and permissioning. The existing authentication and authorization (auth) system is not centralized; it mixes concerns between page rendering and permissions management. The new system separates auth into its own software layer, separate entirely from page rendering. This new layer is itself split into separate authentication and authorization steps. New feature development and refinement will be made easier by the strong separations between the different components of SynBioHub.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Authentication and Authorization on SynBioHub","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Zhang","Zach Zundel","Chris J.

Computational modeling often requires expert knowledge and data to build models. Clearly, manual creation of models is not scalable for large designs. Despite several automated model construction approaches, computational methodologies to bridge knowledge in design repositories and the process of creating computational models have still not been established. This paper describes a workflow for automatic generation of computational models of genetic circuits from data stored in design repositories using existing standards. This workflow leverages the software tool SBOLDesigner to build structural models that are then enriched by the Virtual Parts Repository API using Systems Biology Open Language (SBOL) data fetched from the SynBioHub design repository. The iBioSim software tool is then utilized to convert this SBOL description into a computational model encoded using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Finally, this SBML model can be simulated using a variety of methods. This workflow provides synthetic biologists with easy to use tools to create predictable biological systems, hiding away the complexity of building computational models. This approach can further be incorporated into other computational workflows for design automation.","tags":[],"title":"A Computational Workflow for the Automated Generation of Models of Genetic Designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Fontanarrosa","Hamid Hosseini","Amin Borujeni","Yuval Dorfan","Chris Voigt","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236481,"objectID":"b26fabd2689bdf65ad1f6c4d349fb9de","permalink":"/publication/analyzing-genetic-circuits-fontanarrosa-2019/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:54:40.706405Z","relpermalink":"/publication/analyzing-genetic-circuits-fontanarrosa-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Analyzing Genetic Circuits for Hazards and Glitches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tramy Nguyen","Timothy S.

The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has already emerged as a data standard to represent information about genetic circuits, and it is based on capturing data using graphs. The language provides the syntax using a free text document that is accessible to humans only. This paper describes SBOL-OWL, an ontology for a machine understandable definition of SBOL. This ontology acts as a semantic layer for genetic circuit designs. As a result, computational tools can understand the meaning of design entities in addition to parsing structured SBOL data. SBOL-OWL not only describes how genetic circuits can be constructed computationally, it also facilitates the use of several existing Semantic Web tools for synthetic biology. This paper demonstrates some of these features, for example, to validate designs and check for inconsistencies. Through the use of SBOL-OWL, queries can be simplified and become more intuitive. Moreover, existing reasoners can be used to infer information about genetic circuit designs that cannot be directly retrieved using existing querying mechanisms. This ontological representation of the SBOL standard provides a new perspective to the verification, representation, and querying of information about genetic circuits and is important to incorporate complex design information via the integration of biological ontologies.","tags":[],"title":"SBOL-OWL: An Ontological Approach for Formal and Semantic Representation of Synthetic Biology Information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Falk Schreiber","Björn Sommer","Gary D.

Experiments are difficult to reproduce, the mechanisms behind life are not well understood, and data that we do obtain is difficult to make sense of. Much like traditional engineering fields where engineers draw from a library of reusable parts for their designs, experimental and synthetic biologists have designed biological circuits by drawing from a library of genetic constructs. However, these so-called genetic parts are poorly understood and are therefore limited in their usefulness. Additionally, there are hundreds of thousands of parts and sequences that have been either created or discovered. For my thesis, I filter through this biological noise to provide genetic circuit designers a powerful way to search for and access the genetic parts that are useful to them. This thesis is focused on creating SBOLExplorer, a system that is used to provide intuitive search within the SynBioHub genetic design repository. SynBioHub integrates genetic construct data from various sources and transforms and stores this data in a standardized data model. By tackling the intricate data mining and data infrastructure problems associated with large-scale semi-structured and noisy data, the search, transformation, and storage of data in genetic design repositories can be enhanced. In particular, this thesis focuses on improving the usability of genetic part repositories' search capabilities. By clustering SynBioHub's genetic parts into many derived collections, duplicate parts are merged. From there, a graph analysis algorithm is used to rank collections of parts by popularity and usefulness. Finally, data infrastructure challenges relating to indexing, storing, serving, and distributed search are solved. The end goal of SBOLExplorer is to integrate these findings into SynBioHub and other genetic design repositories' data representation, search functionality, and data infrastructure.","tags":[],"title":"SBOLExplorer: Data Infrastructure and Data Mining for Genetic Design Repositories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leandro Watanabe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236542,"objectID":"6eaed994e43847f1a76c93dd2ef4932c","permalink":"/publication/scalable-reproducible-modeling-watanabe-2019/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:42.662875Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scalable-reproducible-modeling-watanabe-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Scalable and Reproducible Modeling and Simulation for Heterogeneous Populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meher Samineni"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236545,"objectID":"07fc389867b8b035c40fa3085f52389b","permalink":"/publication/software-compliance-testing-samineni-2019/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:44.71738Z","relpermalink":"/publication/software-compliance-testing-samineni-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Software Compliance Testing for Workflows Using the Synthetic Biology Open Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maxwell Lewis Neal","Matthias König","David Nickerson","Göksel Mısırlı","Reza Kalbasi","Andreas Dräger","Koray Atalag","Vijayalakshmi Chelliah","Michael T Cooling","Daniel L Cook","Sharon Crook","Miguel de Alba","Samuel H Friedman","Alan Garny","John H Gennari","Padraig Gleeson","Martin Golebiewski","Michael Hucka","Nick Juty","Chris Myers","Brett G Olivier","Herbert M Sauro","Martin Scharm","Jacky L Snoep","Vasundra Touré","Anil Wipat","Olaf Wolkenhauer","Dagmar Waltemath"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236515,"objectID":"6e3d920e3658041dd2d5d005bf95dd37","permalink":"/publication/harmonizing-semantic-annotations-neal-2019/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:15.621609Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harmonizing-semantic-annotations-neal-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Harmonizing Semantic Annotations for Computational Models in Biology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Automated reasoning is a field of computer science devoted to the development of algorithms that yield trustworthy answers, providing a basis of sound logical reasoning. For example, in the semiconductor industry formal verification is instrumental to ensuring that chip designs are free of defects (or ``bugs''). Over the past 15 years, systems biology and systems medicine have been introduced in an attempt to understand the enormous complexity of life from a computational point of view. This has generated a wealth of new knowledge in the form of computational models, whose staggering complexity makes manual analysis methods infeasible. Sound, trusted, and automated means of analysing the models are thus required in order to be able to trust their conclusions. Above all, this is crucial to engineering safe biomedical devices and to reducing our reliance on wet-lab experiments and clinical trials, which will in turn produce lower economic and societal costs. Some examples of the questions addressed here include: Can we automatically adjust medications for patients with multiple chronic conditions? Can we verify that an artificial pancreas system delivers insulin in a way that ensures Type 1 diabetic patients never suffer from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia? And lastly, can we predict what kind of mutations a cancer cell is likely to undergo?

Software tools are leveraged to provide rapid iteration through the design space, and data standards are used to encode and characterize complicated genetic circuit designs. Specifically, genetic design automation workflows centered around standards, abstraction, and decoupling are utilized to help experimental biologists accomplish their goals. Unfortunately, the software tools that support this workflow are lacking in some critical features such as combinatorial design and support for an extended range of glyphs. These inadequacies hinder the adoption of data standards, and therefore hurt the reproducibility of experiments and results. Necessary details of experiments are not recorded, and the resulting conclusions are therefore not trusted. SBOLDesigner, a sequence-based computer aided design tool, addresses these issues. This thesis will focus on SBOLDesigner's implementation of combinatorial design and the SBOL Visual 2 standard using the SBOL 2 data model. Using SBOLDesigner, experimental biologists are able to visualize their genetic circuits unambiguously and express the full state of their design robustly. This results in higher productivity when designing genetic circuits, more comprehensive circuit descriptions, and most importantly, enhanced reproducibility in the field of synthetic biology.","tags":[],"title":"SBOLDesigner: A Hierarchical Genetic Design Editor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Sidney Cox","Curtis Madsen","James Alastair McLaughlin","Tramy Nguyen","Nicholas Roehner","Bryan Bartley","Jacob Beal","Michael Bissell","Kiri Choi","Kevin Clancy","Raik Grünberg","Chris Macklin","Goksel Misirli","Ernst Oberortner","Matthew Pocock","Meher Samineni","Michael Zhang","Zhen Zhang","Zach Zundel","John H.

However, more complex models require the coupling of multiple formalisms since different biological concepts are better described using different methods, e.g., stationary metabolism is often modeled using flux-balance analysis (FBA) whereas dynamic changes of model components are better described via ODEs. The coupling of FBA and ODE frameworks results in dynamic FBA models. A major challenge is how to describe such hybrid models coupling multiple frameworks in a standardized way, so that they can be exchanged between tools and simulated consistently and in a reproducible manner.$$Results$$ $$This paper presents a scheme and implementation for encoding dynamic FBA models in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), thereby allowing to exchange multi-framework computational models between software tools. The paper shows the feasibility of the approach using various example models and demonstrates that different tools are able to simulate the hybrid models and agree on the results. As part of this work, two independent implementations of a multi-framework simulation method for dynamic FBA have been developed supporting such models: iBioSim and sbmlutils.$$Availability$$ $$All materials and models are available from https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/dfba.

These standards are complementary, so the interactions between their developers increased over time. By the end of the last decade, the community of researchers decided that more interoperability is required between the standards, and that common development is needed to make better use of effort, time, and money devoted to this activity.

Analog and digital parts are closely inter-mixed, hence demanding AMS design methods and tools to be more holistic.

The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology, filling a need not satisfied by other pre-existing standards. This document details version 2.1 of SBOL that builds upon version 2.0 published in last year\u0026rsquo;s JIB special issue. In particular, SBOL 2.1 includes improved rules for what constitutes a valid SBOL document, new role fields to simplify the expression of sequence features and how components are used in context, and new best practices descriptions to improve the exchange of basic sequence topology information and the description of genetic design provenance, as well as miscellaneous other minor improvements.","tags":["\"Programming Languages\"","\"Synthetic Biology\""],"title":"Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) Version 2.1.0","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vladimir Dubikhin","Danil Sokolov","Alex Yakovlev","Chris J.

Although SBML has been successful in representing a wide variety of biochemical models, the core standard lacks the structure for representing large complex regular systems in a standard way, such as whole-cell and cellular population models. These models require a large number of variables to represent certain aspects of these types of models, such as the chromosome in the whole-cell model and the many identical cell models in a cellular population. While SBML core is not designed to handle these types of models efficiently, the proposed SBML arrays package can represent such regular structures more easily. However, in order to take full advantage of the package, analysis needs to be aware of the arrays structure. When expanding the array constructs within a model, some of the advantages of using arrays are lost. This paper describes a more efficient way to simulate arrayed models. To illustrate the proposed method, this paper uses a population of repressilator and genetic toggle switch circuits as examples. Results show that there are memory benefits using this approach with a modest cost in runtime.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient Analysis of Systems Biology Markup Language Models of Cellular Populations Using Arrays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tramy Nguyen","Nicholas Roehner","Zach Zundel","Chris J.

This paper describes the discovery of a potential livelock problem through formal analysis on an extension of the link-fault tolerant NoC architecture introduced by Wu et al. In the process of eliminating this problem, an improved routing architecture is derived. The improvement simplifies the routing architecture, enabling successful verification using the CADP verification toolbox.

When designing and analyzing genetic circuits, researchers are often interested in the probability of observing certain behaviors. Discerning these probabilities typically involves simulating the circuit to produce some time series data and computing statistics over the resulting data. However, for very rare behaviors of complex genetic circuits, it becomes computationally intractable to obtain good results as the number of required simulation runs grows exponentially. It is, therefore, necessary to apply numerical methods to determine these probabilities directly. This article describes how stochastic model checking, a method for determining the likelihood that certain events occur in a system, can by applied to models of genetic circuits by translating them into continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and analyzing them using Markov chain analysis to check continuous stochastic logic (CSL) properties. The utility of this approach is demonstrated with several case studies illustrating how this method can be used to perform design space exploration of two genetic oscillators and two genetic state-holding elements. Our results show that this method results in a substantial speedup as compared with conventional simulation-based approaches.","tags":["\"continuous stochastic logic\"","\"design space exploration\"","\"Markov chain analysis\"","\"Stochastic model checking\"","\"synthetic genetic circuits\""],"title":"Stochastic Model Checking of Genetic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Rodriguez","Alex Thomas","Leandro Watanabe","Ibrahim Y.

The state space reductions used in this framework result in a reduced model that contains the exact same set of observably equivalent executions as in the original model, therefore, no false counter-examples result from the verification of the reduced model. This approach allows designs that cannot be handled monolithically or with partial-order reduction to be verified without difficulty.

The SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification does not directly provide a mechanism for defining hierarchical models, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML packages to extend the Core specification and add additional syntactical constructs. The SBML Hierarchical Model Composition package for SBML Level 3 adds the necessary features to SBML to support hierarchical modeling. The package enables a modeler to include submodels within an enclosing SBML model, delete unneeded or redundant elements of that submodel, replace elements of that submodel with element of the containing model, and replace elements of the containing model with elements of the submodel. In addition, the package defines an optional ``port'' construct, allowing a model to be defined with suggested interfaces between hierarchical components; modelers can chose to use these interfaces, but they are not required to do so and can still interact directly with model elements if they so chose. Finally, the SBML Hierarchical Model Composition package is defined in such a way that a hierarchical model can be ``flattened'' to an equivalent, non-hierarchical version that uses only plain SBML constructs, thus enabling software tools that do not yet support hierarchy to nevertheless work with SBML hierarchical models.$$","tags":[],"title":"SBML Level 3 Package: Hierarchical Model Composition, Version 1 Release 3","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Falk Schreiber","Gary D.

From nuts and bolts to electronic devices and technological processes, standardised products and processes are all around us. Standards have technological and economic benefits, such as making information exchange, production, and services more efficient. However, novel, innovative areas often either lack proper standards, or documents about standards in these areas are not available from a centralised platform or formal body (such as the International Standardisation Organisation).$$Systems and synthetic biology is a relatively novel area, and it is only in the last decade that the standardisation of data, information, and models related to systems and synthetic biology has become a community-wide effort. Several open standards have been established and are under continuous development as a community initiative. COMBINE, the `COmputational Modeling in BIology' NEtwork [1] has been established as an umbrella initiative to coordinate and promote the development of the various community standards and formats for computational models. There are yearly two meeting, HARMONY (Hackathons on Resources for Modeling in Biology), Hackathon-type meetings with a focus on development of the support for standards, and COMBINE forums, workshop-style events with oral presentations, discussion, poster, and breakout sessions for further developing the standards. For more information see http://co.mbine.org/.$$So far the different standards were published and made accessible through the standards' web-pages or preprint services. The aim of this special issue is to provide a single, easily accessible and citable platform for the publication of standards in systems and synthetic biology. This special issue is intended to serve as a central access point to standards and related initiatives in systems and synthetic biology, it will be published annually to provide an opportunity for standard development groups to communicate updated specifications.$$","tags":[],"title":"Specifications of Standards in Systems and Synthetic Biology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

To reduce the complexity, one often specializes to hybrid systems where the complexity is more manageable.

Zones are a restricted class of polyhedra formed by considering the intersections of half-planes defined by two variable constraints. Due to their simplicity, zones have simpler, more efficient methods of manipulation than more general polyhedral classes, though they are less accurate.

To this end, we have developed a genetic technology mapping algorithm that builds on the directed acyclic graph (DAG) based mapping techniques originally used to select parts for digital electronic circuit designs and implemented it in our GDA tool, iBioSim. It is among the first genetic technology mapping algorithms to adapt techniques from electronic circuit design, in particular the use of a cost function to guide the search for an optimal solution, and perhaps that which makes the greatest use of standards for describing genetic function and structure to represent design specifications and component libraries. This paper demonstrates the use of our algorithm to map the specifications for three different genetic circuits against four randomly generated libraries of increasing size to evaluate its performance against both exhaustive search and greedy variants for finding optimal and near-optimal solutions.","tags":[],"title":"Directed Acyclic Graph-Based Technology Mapping of Genetic Circuit Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew N.

The success of these projects, however, has often failed in translation and application to new projects, a problem exacerbated by a lack of engineering standards that combine descriptions of the structure and function of DNA. To address this need, this paper describes a methodology to connect the systems biology markup language (SBML) to the synthetic biology open language (SBOL), existing standards that describe biochemical models and DNA components, respectively. Our methodology involves first annotating SBML model elements such as species and reactions with SBOL DNA components. A graph is then constructed from the model, with vertices corresponding to elements within the model and edges corresponding to the cause-and-effect relationships between these elements. Lastly, the graph is traversed to assemble the annotating DNA components into a composite DNA component, which is used to annotate the model itself and can be referenced by other composite models and DNA components. In this way, our methodology can be used to build up a hierarchical library of models annotated with DNA components. Such a library is a useful input to any future genetic technology mapping algorithm that would automate the process of composing DNA components to satisfy a behavioral specification. Our methodology for SBML-to-SBOL annotation is implemented in the latest version of our genetic design automation (GDA) software tool, iBioSim.","tags":[],"title":"A Methodology to Annotate Systems Biology Markup Language Models with the Synthetic Biology Open Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhen Zhang","Wendelin Serwe","Jian Wu","Tomohiro Yoneda","Hao Zheng","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236513,"objectID":"9e769d3c632ec0284fe001f0f45d28b9","permalink":"/publication/formal-analysis-fault-tolerant-zhang-2014/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:12.870962Z","relpermalink":"/publication/formal-analysis-fault-tolerant-zhang-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"A fault-tolerant routing algorithm in Network-on-Chip architectures provides adaptivity for on-chip communications.

Usually, this involves simulating the system to produce some time series data and analyzing this data to discern the state probabilities. However, as the complexity of models of genetic circuits grow, it becomes more difficult for researchers to reason about the different states by looking only at time series simulation results of the models. To address this problem, this paper employs the use of stochastic model checking, a method for determining the likelihood that certain events occur in a system, with continuous stochastic logic (CSL) properties to obtain similar results. This goal is accomplished by the introduction of a methodology for converting a genetic circuit model (GCM) into a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). This CTMC is analyzed using transient Markov chain analysis to determine the likelihood that the circuit satisfies a given CSL property in a finite amount of time. This paper illustrates a use of this methodology to determine the likelihood of failure in a genetic toggle switch and compares these results to stochastic simulation-based analysis of this same circuit. Our results show that this method results in a substantial speedup as compared with conventional simulation-based approaches.","tags":["\"Analytical models\"","\"complex networks\"","\"Computational modeling\"","\"continuous stochastic logic\"","\"continuous time Markov chain\"","\"CSL properties\"","\"CTMC\"","\"equivalent circuits\"","\"genetic circuit analysis\"","\"genetic circuit complexity\"","\"genetic circuit design\"","\"genetic circuits\"","\"genetic toggle switch\"","\"genetics\"","\"Genetics\"","\"Integrated circuit modeling\"","\"markov chain analysis\"","\"Markov processes\"","\"molecular biophysics\"","\"Production\"","\"stochastic model checking\"","\"Stochastic processes\"","\"Switches\"","\"synthetic biology\"","\"transient Markov chain analysis\""],"title":"Utilizing Stochastic Model Checking to Analyze Genetic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Zheng","Emmanuel Rodriguez","Yingying Zhang","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236497,"objectID":"b5c31c39f354ce630f9d9383807c0331","permalink":"/publication/compositional-minimization-approach-zheng-2012/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:54:57.705528Z","relpermalink":"/publication/compositional-minimization-approach-zheng-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a compositional minimization approach with efficient state space reductions for verifying non-trivial asynchronous designs.

One of the assumptions made by SCK is that each reaction be an elementary step which cannot be broken down into smaller steps. As such, transition events of the SCK model occur spontaneously in that there is no time lag between the reaction initiation and completion. In practice, however, it is very difficult to experimentally determine if an observed state change is a result of an elementary reaction or a sequence of several reaction steps. To test various hypotheses on such time-delays through the use of the SCK, all of the intermediate reactions and species need to be explicitly specified, which can quickly become cumbersome. To more efficiently model and analyze potential effects of such intermediate reaction steps, this paper proposes a new formalism for higher-level discrete-stochastic treatment of biological systems with reaction delays. Our new formalism can represent a time delay caused by intermediate reaction steps as an Erlang random variable, allowing a model's size to be reduced substantially. This paper illustrates an application of this formalism for analysis of the effect of different transcription elongation steps and rates on the distribution of RNA molecules.","tags":[],"title":"Erlang-Delayed Stochastic Chemical Kinetic Formalism for Efficient Analysis of Biological Systems with Non-Elementary Reaction Effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K Jones"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1304208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236488,"objectID":"91d0532e081bced316e7d28e15d682de","permalink":"/publication/automated-abstraction-labeled-jones-2011/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:54:47.901174Z","relpermalink":"/publication/automated-abstraction-labeled-jones-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Automated Abstraction of Labeled Petri Nets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Patterson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1304208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236528,"objectID":"178adddf2b81c5c13e04484913fba395","permalink":"/publication/modeling-visualization-synthetic-patterson-2011/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:28.718124Z","relpermalink":"/publication/modeling-visualization-synthetic-patterson-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Modeling and Visualization of Synthetic Genetic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott Little","David Walter","Chris Myers","Robert Thacker","Satish Batchu","Tomohiro Yoneda"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1301616000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236566,"objectID":"7e32b305b9c6f51cab78b5880ce350f4","permalink":"/publication/verification-analog-mixed-signal-little-2011/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:56:06.536049Z","relpermalink":"/publication/verification-analog-mixed-signal-little-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Mixed-signal designs integrate digital and analog circuits which complicates the already difficult verification problem.

This information can be used to understand the genetic regulatory network that generates the data. Typically, Bayesian analysis approaches are applied which neglect the time series nature of the experimental data, have difficulty in determining the direction of causality, and do not perform well on networks with tight feedback. To address these problems, this paper presents a method to learn genetic network connectivity which exploits the time series nature of experimental data to achieve better causal predictions. This method first breaks up the data into bins. Next, it determines an initial set of potential influence vectors for each gene based upon the probability of the gene's expression increasing in the next time step. These vectors are then combined to form new vectors with better scores. Finally, these influence vectors are competed against each other to determine the final influence vector for each gene. The result is a directed graph representation of the genetic network's repression and activation connections. Results are reported for several synthetic networks with tight feedback showing significant improvements in recall and runtime over Yu's dynamic Bayesian approach. Promising preliminary results are also reported for an analysis of experimental data for genes involved in the yeast cell cycle.","tags":["\"Algorithms\"","\"Artificial Intelligence\"","\"Bacteriophage lambda\"","\"Bayes Theorem\"","\"Bayesian analysis\"","\"Bayesian methods\"","\"belief networks\"","\"biological techniques\"","\"biology computing\"","\"Cell Cycle\"","\"cellular biophysics\"","\"Cellular networks\"","\"Computational biology\"","\"Computational Biology\"","\"Data analysis\"","\"Feedback\"","\"gene expression\"","\"Gene Expression Profiling\"","\"Gene Regulatory Networks\"","\"Genes; Fungal\"","\"Genes; Viral\"","\"Genetic expression\"","\"genetic network activation connection\"","\"genetic network repression connection\"","\"genetic regulatory network connectivity\"","\"genetic regulatory networks\"","\"genetics\"","\"graphical models\"","\"Learning influences\"","\"Models; Genetic\"","\"molecular biophysics\"","\"Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis\"","\"Performance analysis\"","\"Runtime\"","\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"","\"Time Factors\"","\"Time series analysis\"","\"time series data\"","\"yeast cell cycle\"","\"Yu dynamic Bayesian approach\""],"title":"Learning Genetic Regulatory Network Connectivity from Time Series Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Satish Batchu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1291161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236491,"objectID":"3023f9d58eaf227040cddfac6b3f7dec","permalink":"/publication/automatic-extraction-behavioral-batchu-2010/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:54:50.951017Z","relpermalink":"/publication/automatic-extraction-behavioral-batchu-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Automatic Extraction of Behavioral Models from Simulations of Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiroyuki Kuwahara","Curtis Madsen","Ivan Mura","Chris Myers","Abiezer Tejeda","Chris Winstead"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1280620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236506,"objectID":"9a7226ef8f1c523e22714bfdd44ba205","permalink":"/publication/effecient-stochastic-simulation-kuwahara-2010/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:06.314513Z","relpermalink":"/publication/effecient-stochastic-simulation-kuwahara-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Open access peer-reviewed chapter","tags":[],"title":"Effecient Stochastic Simulation to Analyze Targeted Properties of Biological Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haiqiong Yao","Hao Zheng","Chris J.

Three designs are considered for the genetic Muller C-element: a majority gate, a toggle switch, and a speed-independent implementation. While the three designs are logically equivalent, each design requires different assumptions to operate correctly. The majority gate design requires the most timing assumptions, the speed-independent design requires the least, and the toggle switch design is a compromise between the two. This paper examines the robustness of these designs as well as the effects of parameter variation using stochastic simulation. The results show that robustness to timing assumptions does not necessarily increase reliability, suggesting that modifications to existing logic design tools are going to be necessary for synthetic biology. Parameter variation simulations yield further insights into the design principles necessary for building robust genetic gates. The results suggest that high gene count, cooperativity of at least two, tight repression, and balanced decay rates are necessary for robust gates. Finally, this paper presents a potential application of the genetic Muller C-element as a quorum-mediated trigger.","tags":["\"Genetic circuit\"","\"Synthetic logic gate\""],"title":"Design and Analysis of a Robust Genetic Muller C-Element","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Winstead","Curtis Madsen","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1272672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236523,"objectID":"9d7a30c22eb4e682d90ca00f04c37243","permalink":"/publication/issa-incremental-stochastic-winstead-2010/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:23.623034Z","relpermalink":"/publication/issa-incremental-stochastic-winstead-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Researchers are now developing synthetic genetic circuits to manipulate the biochemical processes within living cells. In order to model and predict the behavior of these circuits, the designer must account for numerous reactions among many chemical species and genetic components. The analysis of genetic circuits is complicated by the fact that small molecule counts and sporadic gene expression makes stochastic simulation necessary. However, the examination of statistics on ensembles of stochastic simulation runs can hide important behavior. To address this problem, this paper introduces a new method called the incremental stochastic simulation algorithm (iSSA) which determines statistics on typical behavior. This paper illustrates the utility of this algorithm on a circadian rhythm model and a model of a synthetic dual-feedback genetic oscillator.","tags":["\"Analytical models\"","\"biochemical process\"","\"biochemistry\"","\"biomolecular electronics\"","\"cellular biophysics\"","\"Chemicals\"","\"Circadian rhythm\"","\"circadian rhythm model\"","\"Circuit analysis\"","\"circuit simulation\"","\"Circuit simulation\"","\"Gene expression\"","\"genetics\"","\"Genetics\"","\"incremental stochastic simulation algorithm\"","\"iSSA\"","\"living cells\"","\"Predictive models\"","\"Statistics\"","\"stochastic processes\"","\"Stochastic processes\"","\"synthetic dual feedback genetic oscillator\"","\"synthetic genetic circuits\""],"title":"iSSA: An Incremental Stochastic Simulation Algorithm for Genetic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott Little","David Walter","Kevin Jones","Chris Myers","Alper Sen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1270080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236480,"objectID":"8887011f0eea0d4c3011e44569558046","permalink":"/publication/analog-mixedsignal-circuit-little-2010/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:54:40.144162Z","relpermalink":"/publication/analog-mixedsignal-circuit-little-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Verification of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining circuit models at suitable levels of abstraction.

A key UPEC molecular virulence mechanism is type 1 fimbriae, whose expression is controlled by the orientation of an invertible chromosomal DNA element— the fim switch. Temperature has been shown to act as a major regulator of fim switching behavior and is overall an important indicator as well as functional feature of many urologic diseases, including UPEC host-pathogen interaction dynamics. Given this panoptic physiological role of temperature during UTI progression and notable empirical challenges to its direct in vivo studies, in silico modeling of corresponding biochemical and biophysical mechanisms essential to UPEC pathogenicity may significantly aid our understanding of the underlying disease processes. However, rigorous computational analysis of biological systems, such as fim switch temperature control circuit, has hereto presented a notoriously demanding problem due to both the substantial complexity of the gene regulatory networks involved as well as their often characteristically discrete and stochastic dynamics. To address these issues, we have developed an approach that enables automated multiscale abstraction of biological system descriptions based on reaction kinetics. Implemented as a computational tool, this method has allowed us to efficiently analyze the modular organization and behavior of the E. coli fimbriation switch circuit at different temperature settings, thus facilitating new insights into this mode of UPEC molecular virulence regulation. In particular, our results suggest that, with respect to its role in shutting down fimbriae expression, the primary function of FimB recombinase may be to effect a controlled down-regulation (rather than increase) of the ON-to-OFF fim switching rate via temperature-dependent suppression of competing dynamics mediated by recombinase FimE. Our computational analysis further implies that this down-regulation mechanism could be particularly significant inside the host environment, thus potentially contributing further understanding toward the development of novel therapeutic approaches to UPEC-caused UTIs.","tags":["\"Bacterial pathogens\"","\"Biochemical simulations\"","\"Electrical circuits\"","\"Logic circuits\"","\"Pili and fimbriae\"","\"Simulation and modeling\"","\"Synthetic genetic networks\"","\"Virulence factors\""],"title":"Temperature Control of Fimbriation Circuit Switch in Uropathogenic Escherichia Coli: Quantitative Analysis via Automated Model Abstraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiroyuki Kuwahara","Chris J.

This paper introduces a new approximation method to reduce the computational cost of stochastic simulations of an enzymatic reaction scheme which in biochemical systems often includes rapidly changing fast reactions with enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex molecules present in very small counts. Our new method removes the substrate dissociation reaction by approximating the passage time of the formation of each enzyme-substrate complex molecule which is destined to a production reaction. This approach skips the firings of unimportant yet expensive reaction events, resulting in a substantial acceleration in the stochastic simulations of enzymatic reactions. Additionally, since all the parameters used in our new approach can be derived by the Michaelis-Menten parameters which can actually be measured from experimental data, applications of this approximation can be practical even without having full knowledge of the underlying enzymatic reaction. Here, we apply this new method to various enzymatic reaction systems, resulting in a speedup of orders of magnitude in temporal behavior analysis without any significant loss in accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our new method can perform better than some of the best existing approximation methods for enzymatic reactions in terms of accuracy and efficiency.","tags":["\"Algorithms\"","\"Computer Simulation\"","\"Enzymes\"","\"Mathematics\"","\"Models; Biological\"","\"Models; Chemical\"","\"Models; Statistical\""],"title":"Production-Passage-Time Approximation: A New Approximation Method to Accelerate the Simulation Process of Enzymatic Reactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nam Nguyen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1217548800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236500,"objectID":"c95f4517dd8d3d770b983c29aa56a528","permalink":"/publication/design-analysis-genetic-nguyen-2008/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:55:00.542088Z","relpermalink":"/publication/design-analysis-genetic-nguyen-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Design and Analysis of Genetic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Naohiro Hamada","Yuuki Shiga","Hiroshi Saito","Tomohiro Yoneda","Chris Myers","Takashi Nanya"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1212278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236492,"objectID":"4a62a960cd30e95c7684179b12f55bba","permalink":"/publication/behavioral-synthesis-method-naohirohamada-2008/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:54:52.533473Z","relpermalink":"/publication/behavioral-synthesis-method-naohirohamada-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a behavioral synthesis method for asynchronous circuits with bundled-data implementation.

Previous papers proposed either exact algorithms, which suffer from statespace explosion, or efficient algorithms which use a (conservative) approximation to avoid state-space explosion but can result in the rejection of designs which are valid. In particular, [7] presents a timed extention of the work in [1] which is very efficient but is not able to handle circuits with internal loops, which prevents its use in some cases. We propose a new approach to the problem in order to overcome the mentioned limitations, without sacrificing efficiency. To do so, we first introduce a general framework targeted at the conservative checking of safety failures. This framework is not restricted to the checking of timed asynchronous circuits. Secondly, we propose a new (conservative) semantics for timed circuits, in order to use the proposed framework for hazard checking of such circuits. Using this framework with the proposed semantics yields an efficient algorithm that addresses the limitations of the previous approaches.","tags":["\"Algorithm design and analysis\"","\"Approximation algorithms\"","\"asynchronous circuits\"","\"Asynchronous circuits\"","\"Circuit synthesis\"","\"Cities and towns\"","\"Explosions\"","\"hazard checking\"","\"Hazards\"","\"Informatics\"","\"internal loops\"","\"Safety\"","\"safety failures\"","\"Signal synthesis\"","\"state- space explosion\"","\"timed asynchronous circuits\""],"title":"Hazard Checking of Timed Asynchronous Circuits Revisited","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomohiro Yoneda","Chris J.

In particular, this method synthesizes each output individually. It begins by contracting the timed signal transition graph (STG) to include only transitions on the output of interest and its possible trigger signals. Next, the reachable state space for this contracted STG is analyzed to determine a minimal number of additional signals, which must be reintroduced into the STG to obtain complete state coding. The circuit for this output is then synthesized from this STG. Results show that the quality of the circuit implementation is nearly as good as the one found from the full reachable state space, but it can be applied to find circuits for which full-state-space methods cannot be successfully applied.

Timed circuits are a class of asynchronous circuits that are optimized using explicit timing information. In asynchronous circuits, correct operation requires that there are no hazards in the circuit implementation. Therefore, when designing an asynchronous circuit, each internal node and output of the circuit must be verified for hazard-freedom to ensure correct operation. Current verification algorithms for timed circuits require an explicit state exploration that often results in state explosion for even modest-sized examples. The goal of this paper is to abstract the behavior of internal nodes and utilize this information to make a conservative determination of hazard-freedom for each node in the circuit. Experimental results indicate that this approach is substantially more efficient than existing timing verification tools. These results also indicate that this method scales well for large examples that could not be previously analyzed, in that it is capable of analyzing these circuits in less than a second. While this method is conservative in that some false hazards may be reported, our results indicate that their number is small","tags":["\"asynchronous circuits\"","\"Asynchronous circuits\"","\"Circuit analysis\"","\"Circuit optimization\"","\"Circuit synthesis\"","\"current verification algorithms\"","\"Decoding\"","\"Explosions\"","\"gate level timed asynchronous circuits\"","\"hazard freedom\"","\"Hazard-freedom\"","\"Hazards\"","\"Libraries\"","\"Monte Carlo methods\"","\"Performance gain\"","\"response surface methodology\"","\"technological forecasting\"","\"technology mapping\"","\"timed asynchronous circuits\"","\"Timing\"","\"verification\""],"title":"Efficient Verification of Hazard-Freedom in Gate-Level Timed Asynchronous Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nam-Phuong D.

This paper introduces a new approximation method to reduce the computational cost of stochastic simulations of an enzymatic reaction scheme which in biochemical systems often includes rapidly changing fast reactions with enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex molecules present in very small counts. Our new method removes the substrate dissociation reaction by approximating the passage time of the formation of each enzyme-substrate complex molecule which is destined to a production reaction. This approach skips the firings of unimportant yet expensive reaction events, resulting in a substantial acceleration in the stochastic simulations of enzymatic reactions. Additionally, since all the parameters used in our new approach can be derived by the Michaelis-Menten parameters which can actually be measured from experimental data, applications of this approximation can be practical even without having full knowledge of the underlying enzymatic reaction. Furthermore, since our approach does not require a customized simulation procedure for enzymatic reactions, it allows biochemical systems that include such reactions to still take advantage of standard stochastic simulation tools. Here, we apply this new method to various enzymatic reaction systems, resulting in a speedup of orders of magnitude in temporal behavior analysis without any significant loss in accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Production-Passage-Time Approximation: A New Approximation Method to Accelerate the Simulation Process of Enzymatic Reactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Walter","Scott Little","Nicholas Seegmiller","Chris J.

This method allows us to decompose the verification problem into a set of subproblems, each of which proves that a specific failure condition does not occur. To each subproblem, abstraction is applied using safe transformations to reduce the complexity of verification. The abstraction preserves all essential behaviors conservatively for the specific failure model in the concrete description.

Furthermore, an ability to change the level of abstraction can be very useful when dealing with many biological systems, including gene regulatory networks. These systems typically have too many components and states to be practically studied using all-inclusive low-level models, yet they often manifest enough dynamical and functional complexity, making an entirely high-level qualitative representation similarly inadequate — thus necessitating a search for some intermediate level of abstraction. Finally, while most abstractions used in modeling of biochemical networks have traditionally been performed manually, doing so accurately in a large system is a tedious and time-consuming process that is highly susceptible to errors during model transformation. To address these issues, we have developed a methodology and implemented an automated modeling and analysis tool with variable abstraction level capabilities. In this paper, we use it for the analysis of switching in Type 1 pili expression dynamics and, in particular, for the problem of estimating the effect of H-NS and Lrp regulatory protein levels on phase variation rates in E. coli. Such behavior is notoriously difficult to study due to the size of the associated gene regulatory network and the characteristically stochastic dynamics involved, which result in very high analytical and computational demands. Here, we show how, by using our system, we are able to automatically abstract the switch network and accurately predict E. coli afimbriation rates, while, at the same time, accelerating the required computations by up to two orders of magnitude.

In order to efficiently analyze a large scale system in an automated and objective manner, abstraction is essential. This paper presents an automated abstraction methodology that systematically reduces the small scale complexity found in genetic regulatory network models, while broadly preserving the large scale system behavior. Our approach is to first reduce the number of reactions through a quasisteady-state approximation-based algorithm. Second, it represents the exact molecular state of the system by a set of reduced Boolean (or nary) discrete levels. This results in a chemical master equation that is approximated by a Markov chain with a much smaller state space providing significant simulation time acceleration and computability gains. 1 Background Numerous methods have been proposed to model genetic regulatory networks [1, 2]. While many traditional approaches have relied on a differential equation representation as inferred from a set of underlying biochemical reactions, there has been a growing appreciation of their limitations [3-6]. In particular, differential equation analysis of genetic networks generally assumes that the number of molecules in a cell is high and their concentrations can be viewed as continuous quantities, while their underlying reactions occur deterministically. However, in natural genetic networks these assumptions frequently do not hold as, for example, DNA molecules are typically present in single digit quantities, while some promoters can lead to substantial fluctuations in transcription/translation rates and essentially non-deterministic expression characteristics [7, 8].","tags":[],"title":"Asynchronous Abstraction Methodology for Genetic Regulatory Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhao Yanyi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1101859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236482,"objectID":"de6a699c14939da2d844ccee88efe96d","permalink":"/publication/application-synchronous-synthesis-yanyi-2004/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:54:42.404865Z","relpermalink":"/publication/application-synchronous-synthesis-yanyi-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Application of Synchronous Synthesis Tools for High-Level Asynchronous Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Curtis A.

Timed circuits are a class of asynchronous circuits that utilize explicit timing information for optimization throughout the entire design process. In asynchronous circuits, correct operation requires that there are no hazards in the circuit implementation. Therefore, when designing an asynchronous circuit, each internal node and output of the circuit must be verified for hazard-freedom to ensure correct operation. Current verification algorithms for timed asynchronous circuits require an explicit state exploration often resulting in state explosion for even modest sized examples. The goal of this work is to abstract the behavior of internal nodes and utilize this information to make a conservative determination of hazard-freedom for each node in the circuit. Experimental results indicate that this approach is substantially more efficient than existing timing verification tools. These results also indicate that this method scales well for large examples. It is capable of analyzing circuits in less than a second that could not be previously analyzed.

Achieving fine grained power down and progressive pipeline stalls at the local stage level is therefore becoming increasingly, important to enable lower dynamic power consumption while keeping introduced switching noise under control as well as avoiding global distribution of timing critical stall signals. It has long been known that the interlocking properties of as asynchronous pipelined systems have a potential to provide such benefits. However it has not been understood how such interlocking can be achieved in synchronous pipelines. This paper presents a novel technique based on local clock gating and synchronous handshake protocols that achieves stage level interlocking characteristics in synchronous pipelines similar to that of asynchronous pipelines. The presented technique is directly applicable to traditional synchronous pipelines and works equally well for two-phase clocked pipelines based on transparent latches, as well as one-phase clocked pipelines based on master-slave latches.","tags":["\"Circuit noise\"","\"Clocks\"","\"Control systems\"","\"Design automation\"","\"dynamic power consumption\"","\"Energy consumption\"","\"fine grained power down\"","\"flip-flops\"","\"global distribution\"","\"handshake protocols\"","\"integrated circuit noise\"","\"Integrated circuit noise\"","\"interlocking characteristics\"","\"Jacobian matrices\"","\"Latches\"","\"local clock gating\"","\"local stage level\"","\"locality principles\"","\"low-power electronics\"","\"master-slave latches\"","\"one-phase clocked pipelines\"","\"pipeline processing\"","\"Pipelines\"","\"Power dissipation\"","\"progressive pipeline stalls\"","\"switching noise\"","\"synchronous interlocked pipelines\"","\"timing\"","\"timing critical stall signals\"","\"transparent latches\"","\"two-phase clocked pipelines\"","\"very high speed integrated circuits\""],"title":"Synchronous Interlocked Pipelines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sung-Tae Jung","C.J.

The synthesis procedure begins with a graph specification with timing constraints. A timing analysis extracts the timed concurrency and timed causality relations directly from the specification. Then, a hazard-free implementation of the specification is synthesized by analyzing precedence graphs which are constructed by using the timed concurrency and timed causality relations. The major result of this work is that the method does not suffer from the state explosion problem, in practice achieves significant reductions in synthesis time for the specifications which have a large state space, and generates synthesized circuits that have nearly the same area as compared to previous timed circuit methods. In particular, this paper shows that a timed circuit-not containing circuit hazards under given timing constraints-can be found by using the relations between signal transitions of the specification. Moreover, the relations can be efficiently found using a heuristic timing analysis algorithm. By allowing significantly larger designs to be synthesized, this work is a step toward the development of high-level synthesis tools for system level asynchronous circuits.","tags":["\"Algorithm design and analysis\"","\"asynchronous circuits\"","\"Asynchronous circuits\"","\"circuit hazards\"","\"Circuit synthesis\"","\"Concurrent computing\"","\"direct synthesis\"","\"Explosions\"","\"free-choice STGs\"","\"graph specification\"","\"hazard-free implementation\"","\"Hazards\"","\"hazards and race conditions\"","\"Heuristic algorithms\"","\"heuristic timing analysis\"","\"high level synthesis\"","\"high-level synthesis tools\"","\"Petri nets\"","\"precedence graphs\"","\"Signal synthesis\"","\"signal transition graph\"","\"signal transitions\"","\"state space\"","\"state-space methods\"","\"State-space methods\"","\"synthesis time\"","\"timed asynchronous circuits\"","\"timed causality\"","\"timed concurrency\"","\"timing\"","\"Timing\"","\"timing constraints\""],"title":"Direct Synthesis of Timed Circuits from Free-Choice STGs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomohiro Yoneda","Tomoya Kitai","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1009843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236490,"objectID":"727ed80b05911b002d8705bf4265502d","permalink":"/publication/automatic-derivation-timing-yoneda-2002/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T19:54:50.615919Z","relpermalink":"/publication/automatic-derivation-timing-yoneda-2002/","section":"publication","summary":"This work proposes a technique to automatically obtain timing constraints for a given timed circuit to operate correctly.

The failure trace is analyzed, and sufficient timing constraints to prevent the failure is obtained.

This process terminates when either some delay bounds under which no failure is detected are found or no new delay bounds to prevent the failures can be obtained.

Circuit correctness in these aggressive styles is highly timing dependent and, in industry, they are typically designed by hand. In order to automate the process of designing and verifying timed circuits, algorithms for their synthesis and verification are necessary. This paper presents timed event/level (TEL) structures, a specification formalism for timed circuits that corresponds directly to gate-level circuits. It also presents an algorithm based on partially ordered sets to make the state-space exploration of TEL structures more tractable. The combination of the new specification method and algorithm significantly improves efficiency for gate-level timing verification. Results on a number of circuits, including many from the recently published gigahertz unit Test Site (guTS) processor from IBM indicate that modules of significant size can be verified using a level of abstraction that preserves the interesting timing properties of the circuit. Accurate circuit level verification allows the designer to include less margin in the design, which can lead to increased performance.","tags":["\"Algorithm design and analysis\"","\"asynchronous circuits\"","\"automatic testing\"","\"circuit design\"","\"circuit level verification\"","\"Circuit synthesis\"","\"Circuit testing\"","\"Decoding\"","\"Delay\"","\"gate-level circuits\"","\"gigahertz unit Test Site\"","\"integrated circuit testing\"","\"Logic design\"","\"logic gates\"","\"logic testing\"","\"Microprocessors\"","\"partially ordered sets\"","\"Performance gain\"","\"Process design\"","\"specification formalism\"","\"state-space exploration\"","\"state-space methods\"","\"TEL structures\"","\"timed circuit verification\"","\"timed event/level structures\"","\"timing\"","\"Timing\"","\"timing properties\"","\"VLSI\""],"title":"Timed Circuit Verification Using TEL Structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris J.

Our design eliminates potential metastability problems by using a clock generated by a stoppable ring oscillator, which is capable of driving the large clock load found in present day microprocessors. Using the ATACS design tool, we designed highly optimized transistor-level circuits to control the ring oscillator and generate the clock and handshake signals with minimal overhead. Our interface architecture requires no redesign of the synchronous circuitry. Incorporating asynchronous modules in a high-speed pipeline improves performance by exploiting data-dependent delay variations. Since the speed of the synchronous circuitry tracks the speed of the ring oscillator under different processes, temperatures, and voltages, the entire chip operates at the speed dictated by the current operating conditions, rather than being governed by the worst case conditions. These two factors together can lead to a significant improvement in average-case performance.

Our design eliminates potential metastability problems by using a clock generated by a stoppable ring oscillator, which is capable of driving the large clock load found in present day microprocessors. Using the ATACS design tool, we designed highly optimized transistor-level circuits to control the ring oscillator and generate the clock and handshake signals with minimal overhead. Our interface architecture requires no redesign of the synchronous circuitry. Incorporating asynchronous modules in a high-speed pipeline improves performance by exploiting data-dependent delay variations. Since the speed of the synchronous circuitry tracks the speed of the ring oscillator under different processes, temperatures, and voltages, the entire chip operates at the speed dictated by the current operating conditions, rather than being governed by the worst case conditions. These two factors together can lead to a significant improvement in average-case performance.

The circuits are represented using timed event/level structures. These structures correspond very directly to gate level circuits, making the translation from a transistor schematic to a TEL structure straightforward. The state-space explosion problem is mitigated using an algorithm based on partially ordered sets (POSETs). Results on a number of circuits from the recently published guTS (gigahertz unit Test Site) processor from IBM indicate that modules of significant size can be verified with ATACS using a level of abstraction that preserves the interesting timing properties of the circuit.

Timed circuits are a class of asynchronous circuits that incorporate explicit timing information in the specification. This information is used throughout the synthesis procedure to optimize the design. In order to synthesize a timed circuit, it is necessary to explore the timed state space of the specification. The memory required to store the timed state space of a complex specification can be prohibitive for large designs when explicit representation methods are used. This paper describes the application of BDDs and MTBDDs to the representation of timed state spaces and the synthesis of timed circuits.

It is shown that the resulting timed implementation can be significantly reduced in complexity from its speed-independent counterpart while remaining hazard-free under the given timing constraints.$$","tags":["\"Asynchronous circuits\"","\"asynchronous sequential logic\"","\"Circuit synthesis\"","\"complexity\"","\"Complexity theory\"","\"computational complexity\"","\"Constraint optimization\"","\"cyclic graph specification\"","\"Delay\"","\"Erbium\"","\"formal specification\"","\"infinite acyclic graph\"","\"Laboratories\"","\"logic design\"","\"redundancy\"","\"Robustness\"","\"sufficient condition\"","\"systematic synthesis procedure\"","\"timed asynchronous circuits synthesis\"","\"Timing\"","\"timing constraints\"","\"Wire\""],"title":"Synthesis of Timed Asynchronous Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e2964b19e10396211c0e2248058ae523","permalink":"/tools/atacs/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tools/atacs/","section":"tools","summary":"The ATACS tool is used for the synthesis and verification of timed asynchronous circuits.","tags":null,"title":"ATACS","type":"tools"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"53745226ff1834c27b8e6c21957e2e03","permalink":"/tools/ibiosim/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tools/ibiosim/","section":"tools","summary":"iBioSim has been developed for the modeling, analysis, and design of genetic circuits.
