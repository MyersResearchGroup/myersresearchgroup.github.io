This work allowed for the insertion of the minimum number of context variables by carefully choosing where to insert the variables and their transitions.\nAfter graduation, Chris worked at Hewlett-Packard and Intel in their microprocessor design labs. He developed EDA tools for server microprocessors and worked as a microprocessor performance architect. Over his career, he worked on two HP PA-RISC® processors (8700/8800), 5 Itanium® processors, 1 Xeon® processor and 1 Atom® processor.\nChris returned to school and completed a PhD program in Computer Science at Colorado State University. His advisor was Dr. Michelle Strout. For his dissertation, Krieger researched a new programming language abstraction, called a loop chain. By identifying a group of loops as a loop chain, compilers and runtime optimizers can perform a variety of code and data transformations to improve locality (e.g. full sparse tiling), concurrency (shared memory autoparallelization), or arithmetic intensity (improved vectorization).\nDr. Krieger is now a lead researcher in the Advanced Computing Systems group at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences on the University of Maryland campus.

Recent experimental advances facilitate the collection of time series data that indicate which genes in a cell are expressed. This paper proposes an efficient method to generate the genetic regulatory network inferred from time series data. Our method first encodes the data into levels. Next, it determines the set of potential parents for each gene based upon the probability of the gene's expression increasing. After a subset of potential parents are selected, it determines if any genes in this set may have a combined effect. Finally, the potential sets of parents are competed against each other to determine the final set of parents. The result is a directed graph representation of the genetic network's repression and activation connections. Our results on synthetic data generated from models for several genetic networks with tight feedback are promising. 1","tags":["\"genetic circuit\""],"title":"Learning Genetic Regulatory Network Connectivity from Time Series Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lukas Bücherl","Jeanet Mante","Pedro Fontanarrosa","Zhen Zhang","Brett Jepsen","Riley Roberts","Chris J.

These glitches can have drastic effects if the output of the circuit causes irreversible changes within or with other cells such as a cascade of responses, apoptosis, or the release of a pharmaceutical in an off-target tissue. Therefore, avoiding unwanted variation of a circuit's output can be crucial for the safe operation of a genetic circuit. This paper investigates what causes unwanted switching variations in combinational genetic circuits using hazard analysis and a new dynamic model generator. The analysis is done in previously built and modeled genetic circuits with known glitching behavior. The dynamic models generated not only predict the same steady states as previous models but can also predict the unwanted switching variations that have been observed experimentally. Multiple input changes may cause glitches due to propagation delays within the circuit. Modifying the circuit's layout to alter these delays may change the likelihood of certain glitches, but it cannot eliminate the possibility that the glitch may occur. In other words, function hazards cannot be eliminated. Instead, they must be avoided by restricting the allowed input changes to the system. Logic hazards, on the other hand, can be avoided using hazard-free logic synthesis. This paper demonstrates this by showing how a circuit designed using a popular genetic design automation tool can be redesigned to eliminate logic hazards.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\""],"title":"Genetic Circuit Dynamics: Hazard and Glitch Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarah M Keating","Dagmar Waltemath","Matthias König","Fengkai Zhang","Andreas Dräger","Claudine Chaouiya","Frank T Bergmann","Andrew Finney","Colin S Gillespie","Tomáš Helikar","Stefan Hoops","Rahuman S Malik-Sheriff","Stuart L Moodie","Ion I Moraru","Chris J Myers","Aurélien Naldi","Brett G Olivier","Sven Sahle","James C Schaff","Lucian P Smith","Maciej J Swat","Denis Thieffry","Leandro Watanabe","Darren J Wilkinson","Michael L Blinov","Kimberly Begley","James R Faeder","Harold F Gómez","Thomas M Hamm","Yuichiro Inagaki","Wolfram Liebermeister","Allyson L Lister","Daniel Lucio","Eric Mjolsness","Carole J Proctor","Karthik Raman","Nicolas Rodriguez","Clifford A Shaffer","Bruce E Shapiro","Joerg Stelling","Neil Swainston","Naoki Tanimura","John Wagner","Martin Meier-Schellersheim","Herbert M Sauro","Bernhard Palsson","Hamid Bolouri","Hiroaki Kitano","Akira Funahashi","Henning Hermjakob","John C Doyle","Michael Hucka","SBML Level 3 Community members"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236539,"objectID":"378efb89570edb20a10bd1f9bca46bcb","permalink":"/publication/sbml-level-extensible-keating-2020/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:54.906408Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sbml-level-extensible-keating-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Systems biology has experienced dramatic growth in the number, size, and complexity of computational models.

The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models.

This framework was tested by the development of three example plugins, one of each type as follows: one allowing the submission of SnapGene files, one visualizing the course of different genetic parts, and one preparing plasmid maps for download.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"Plugin\"","\"SBOL\"","\"SynBioHub\""],"title":"Extending SynBioHub's Functionality with Plugins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacob Beal","Angel Goñi-Moreno","Chris Myers","Ariel Hecht","María del Carmen de Vicente","Maria Parco","Markus Schmidt","Kenneth Timmis","Geoff Baldwin","Steffi Friedrichs","Paul Freemont","Daisuke Kiga","Elena Ordozgoiti","Maja Rennig","Leonardo Rios","Kristie Tanner","V̧́tor de Lorenzo","Manuel Porcar"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236526,"objectID":"63f308ad4594dfac2cb252358c2652f3","permalink":"/publication/long-journey-standards-beal-2020/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:49.663889Z","relpermalink":"/publication/long-journey-standards-beal-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthetic biology needs to adopt sound scientific and industry-like standards in order to achieve its ambitious goals of efficient and accurate engineering of biological systems.","tags":[],"title":"The Long Journey towards Standards for Engineering Biosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Göksel Mısırlı","Jacob Beal","Thomas E.

As more biological parts are being discovered, it is vital to have an automated procedure to allow complex circuit designs to be built. Technology mapping is a set of procedures that maps biological components to a design specification. Current technology mapping frameworks for genetic circuits are used to design combinational circuits. This dissertation illustrates the process of building an automated workflow for a technology mapping framework to design synchronous sequential genetic circuits. An automated process to create a library of gates for logic and memory circuits is described to construct gates from DNA parts retrieved from a standardize data repository. Genetic constraints address what parts can be mapped to the design specification when the gates and designs are constructed. The proposed automaton workflow begins with a specification provided in a formal design language, such as Verilog. The input design specification is converted into a genetic regulatory network represented using the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL). The network is decomposed into base functions (NOR gates, inverters, and genetic toggle switches) and matching and covering algorithms are performed to produce the output design. The output design is converted to the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) data format for testing and simulation. The outcome of this work provides the synthetic biology community insights on how asynchronous sequential circuit designs can be built through an automated procedure to perform technology mapping from libraries composed of logic gates and memory circuits.","tags":["\"SBOL\""],"title":"Asynchronous Genetic Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Fontanarrosa"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236489,"objectID":"c784c045c44b93d6a6b01ffcafb65f43","permalink":"/publication/automated-generation-dynamic-fontanarrosa-2019/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:36.984329Z","relpermalink":"/publication/automated-generation-dynamic-fontanarrosa-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline in which biological  components are assembled to form devices with user-defined functions. As in any engineering discipline, modeling is a big part of the design process, since it helps to predict, control, and debug systems in an efficient manner. Systems biology has always been concerned with dynamic models, and a recent increase in high-throughput of experimental data has made it essential to develop dynamic models that can be used for an iterative learning process in a design/build/test workflow. In this thesis work, an automated model generator is created to automatically generate dynamic models for genetic regulatory networks, implemented in the genetic design automation tool, iBioSim. This automated model generator uses parameters stored at an online parts repository and encodes the mathematical models it generates using Systems Biology Markup Language. The automated model generator is then used to model and simulate genetic circuits created with the design environment referred to as Cello. The simulation of the mathematical models produces a dynamical response prediction of each of the circuits, which is unavailable with steady-state modeling. Some of these dynamical responses present unexpected behavior. Using the dynamic models generated with the automatic model generator of this work, an analysis of the predicted behaviors yielded insight into the underlying biology phenomena that cause the observed glitching behavior of these circuits. The last chapter of this thesis is focused mainly on future enhancements to the automated model generator of this work to produce more accurate and precise models not only for genetic regulatory networks in emphEscherichia coli, but any organism where parametrization exists as proposed in this thesis work. It also explores different analysis that could be implemented into the automated model generator of this work, in order to expand the assessment done on genetic circuits.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"iBioSim\""],"title":"Automated Generation of Dynamic Models for Genetic Regulatory Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zach Zundel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236521,"objectID":"80989c1d482b9119e66b25bee1b2c743","permalink":"/publication/improving-authentication-authorization-zundel-2019/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:47.823491Z","relpermalink":"/publication/improving-authentication-authorization-zundel-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthetic Biology is an emerging discipline which uses engineering principles to shape biological behavior. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a standard for describing biological constructs which enables engineering workflows that previous formats, such as GenBank and FASTA, could not. SynBioHub is an online repository for storing and sharing genetic designs. It uses the SBOL standard and an RDF triplestore to store designs, as well as supporting file attachment and external links. Several research efforts in synthetic biology have adopted SynBioHub and SBOL. These research efforts have revealed key areas for improvement in SynBioHub. Improving user sharing and permissioning is a primary target for improvement. The existing system has basic support for sharing with different privilege levels. Unfortunately, its architecture makes it difficult to extend and improve. Due to this difficulty, many features which would make SynBioHub more collaborative have not been implemented. This work aims to make synthetic biology more collaborative by providing a better foundation for experimentation and innovation in user sharing and permissioning. The existing authentication and authorization (auth) system is not centralized; it mixes concerns between page rendering and permissions management. The new system separates auth into its own software layer, separate entirely from page rendering. This new layer is itself split into separate authentication and authorization steps. New feature development and refinement will be made easier by the strong separations between the different components of SynBioHub.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"SBOL\"","\"Search\"","\"SynBioHub\""],"title":"Improving Authentication and Authorization on SynBioHub","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Zhang","Zach Zundel","Chris J.

Computational modeling often requires expert knowledge and data to build models. Clearly, manual creation of models is not scalable for large designs. Despite several automated model construction approaches, computational methodologies to bridge knowledge in design repositories and the process of creating computational models have still not been established. This paper describes a workflow for automatic generation of computational models of genetic circuits from data stored in design repositories using existing standards. This workflow leverages the software tool SBOLDesigner to build structural models that are then enriched by the Virtual Parts Repository API using Systems Biology Open Language (SBOL) data fetched from the SynBioHub design repository. The iBioSim software tool is then utilized to convert this SBOL description into a computational model encoded using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Finally, this SBML model can be simulated using a variety of methods. This workflow provides synthetic biologists with easy to use tools to create predictable biological systems, hiding away the complexity of building computational models. This approach can further be incorporated into other computational workflows for design automation.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"iBioSim\"","\"SBOL\"","\"SBOLDesigner\"","\"SynBioHub\""],"title":"A Computational Workflow for the Automated Generation of Models of Genetic Designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Fontanarrosa","Hamid Hosseini","Amin Borujeni","Yuval Dorfan","Chris Voigt","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236481,"objectID":"b26fabd2689bdf65ad1f6c4d349fb9de","permalink":"/publication/analyzing-genetic-circuits-fontanarrosa-2019/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:34.794984Z","relpermalink":"/publication/analyzing-genetic-circuits-fontanarrosa-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"genetic circuit\""],"title":"Analyzing Genetic Circuits for Hazards and Glitches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tramy Nguyen","Timothy S.

This ontology acts as a semantic layer for genetic circuit designs. As a result, computational tools can understand the meaning of design entities in addition to parsing structured SBOL data. SBOL-OWL not only describes how genetic circuits can be constructed computationally, it also facilitates the use of several existing Semantic Web tools for synthetic biology. This paper demonstrates some of these features, for example, to validate designs and check for inconsistencies. Through the use of SBOL-OWL, queries can be simplified and become more intuitive. Moreover, existing reasoners can be used to infer information about genetic circuit designs that cannot be directly retrieved using existing querying mechanisms. This ontological representation of the SBOL standard provides a new perspective to the verification, representation, and querying of information about genetic circuits and is important to incorporate complex design information via the integration of biological ontologies.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"SBOL\""],"title":"SBOL-OWL: An Ontological Approach for Formal and Semantic Representation of Synthetic Biology Information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Falk Schreiber","Björn Sommer","Gary D.

Experiments are difficult to reproduce, the mechanisms behind life are not well understood, and data that we do obtain is difficult to make sense of. Much like traditional engineering fields where engineers draw from a library of reusable parts for their designs, experimental and synthetic biologists have designed biological circuits by drawing from a library of genetic constructs. However, these so-called genetic parts are poorly understood and are therefore limited in their usefulness. Additionally, there are hundreds of thousands of parts and sequences that have been either created or discovered. For my thesis, I filter through this biological noise to provide genetic circuit designers a powerful way to search for and access the genetic parts that are useful to them. This thesis is focused on creating SBOLExplorer, a system that is used to provide intuitive search within the SynBioHub genetic design repository. SynBioHub integrates genetic construct data from various sources and transforms and stores this data in a standardized data model. By tackling the intricate data mining and data infrastructure problems associated with large-scale semi-structured and noisy data, the search, transformation, and storage of data in genetic design repositories can be enhanced. In particular, this thesis focuses on improving the usability of genetic part repositories' search capabilities. By clustering SynBioHub's genetic parts into many derived collections, duplicate parts are merged. From there, a graph analysis algorithm is used to rank collections of parts by popularity and usefulness. Finally, data infrastructure challenges relating to indexing, storing, serving, and distributed search are solved. The end goal of SBOLExplorer is to integrate these findings into SynBioHub and other genetic design repositories' data representation, search functionality, and data infrastructure.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"SBOL\"","\"SBOLExplorer\"","\"Search\"","\"SynBioHub\""],"title":"SBOLExplorer: Data Infrastructure and Data Mining for Genetic Design Repositories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leandro Watanabe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236542,"objectID":"6eaed994e43847f1a76c93dd2ef4932c","permalink":"/publication/scalable-reproducible-modeling-watanabe-2019/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:56.318963Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scalable-reproducible-modeling-watanabe-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Advancements in the systems and synthetic biology fields have proved that biology can be engineered. The development of computer-aided design (CAD) tools has contributed to advancements in these fields. Mathematical modeling and simulation methods are important assets of CAD tools that are frequently applied to the systems and synthetic biology fields. Modeling and simulation methods are used to understand or predict the behavior of a biological system being studied. However, many modeling efforts in those fields face a reproducibility problem, where many published models are not reproducible. In order to address such issue, standards have been created for the representation of biological models. A major advantage of standards is that they enable model reuse and sharing. The leading standard representation of biological systems is the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). The SBML standard is used to describe how biological processes affect and modify biological entities in a system. Such standard has been widely used to describe biochemical networks, cell signaling path, and gene regulation, among others. Unfortunately, not all models use SBML since there are many biological systems that SBML is incapable of representing efficiently, such as heterogeneous cellular populations. This dissertation explores extensions to SBML for the efficient representation of large heterogeneous cellular populations and simulation methods that can simulate such complex models efficiently. Since cellular populations are inherently hierarchical, this dissertation proposes an efficient simulator for hierarchical SBML models. Since the hierarchical structure is preserved in the proposed simulator, the hierarchical simulator is a perfect fit for handling hybrid models. However, no one has explored the coupling of different modeling formalisms within the same SBML model. Hence, this dissertation proposes a methodology that can be used to describe hybrid models. Such methodology is demonstrated by using dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) models as examples and such models can be successfully exchanged between tools. This dissertation also discusses extensions to the SBML data model to support regular structures in the form of arrays. Arrays is well-suited for population models since population models use large regular structures. Another application of arrays is microsimulation of disease models, where a population of individuals with unique characteristics need to be model. With the proposed arrays extension, simulators need to scale in order to handle the increase complexity that the arrays extension introduces. Hence, this dissertation also proposes an efficient simulation method that takes advantages of arrays.","tags":[],"title":"Scalable and Reproducible Modeling and Simulation for Heterogeneous Populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meher Samineni"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236545,"objectID":"07fc389867b8b035c40fa3085f52389b","permalink":"/publication/software-compliance-testing-samineni-2019/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:57.111108Z","relpermalink":"/publication/software-compliance-testing-samineni-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Data standards are integral for interoperability between software applications, since they provide guidelines for how data can be meaningfully exchanged and in a uniform manner. While standards provide a bridge for applications to share and translate data, they do not guarantee that applications are compatible to perform a data exchange or that any translated data is legal and valid. As such, data passed from pairing applications must be validated to ensure that the data was not transformed or lost in the process of exchanging information. Ideally we would want an exchange between tools that is automatically successful; however, the data translated might not be legal or valid any longer. Therefore, data exchanges between applications need to be evaluated under conditions to ensure that compliance with the standard is met. The proposed research is to develop a compliance methodology that tests compliance of applications against the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard. This research aims to provide a robust test suite, a TestRunner tool implementing the compliance strategy, and a demonstration of the created methodology.","tags":["\"SBOL\"","\"Search\""],"title":"Software Compliance Testing for Workflows Using the Synthetic Biology Open Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maxwell Lewis Neal","Matthias König","David Nickerson","Göksel Mısırlı","Reza Kalbasi","Andreas Dräger","Koray Atalag","Vijayalakshmi Chelliah","Michael T Cooling","Daniel L Cook","Sharon Crook","Miguel de Alba","Samuel H Friedman","Alan Garny","John H Gennari","Padraig Gleeson","Martin Golebiewski","Michael Hucka","Nick Juty","Chris Myers","Brett G Olivier","Herbert M Sauro","Martin Scharm","Jacky L Snoep","Vasundra Touré","Anil Wipat","Olaf Wolkenhauer","Dagmar Waltemath"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236515,"objectID":"6e3d920e3658041dd2d5d005bf95dd37","permalink":"/publication/harmonizing-semantic-annotations-neal-2019/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:45.895188Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harmonizing-semantic-annotations-neal-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Harmonizing Semantic Annotations for Computational Models in Biology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Software tools are leveraged to provide rapid iteration through the design space, and data standards are used to encode and characterize complicated genetic circuit designs. Specifically, genetic design automation workflows centered around standards, abstraction, and decoupling are utilized to help experimental biologists accomplish their goals. Unfortunately, the software tools that support this workflow are lacking in some critical features such as combinatorial design and support for an extended range of glyphs. These inadequacies hinder the adoption of data standards, and therefore hurt the reproducibility of experiments and results. Necessary details of experiments are not recorded, and the resulting conclusions are therefore not trusted. SBOLDesigner, a sequence-based computer aided design tool, addresses these issues. This thesis will focus on SBOLDesigner's implementation of combinatorial design and the SBOL Visual 2 standard using the SBOL 2 data model. Using SBOLDesigner, experimental biologists are able to visualize their genetic circuits unambiguously and express the full state of their design robustly.

The adoption and use of SynBioHub, a community-driven effort, has the potential to overcome the reproducibility challenge across laboratories by helping to address the current lack of information about published designs.","tags":["\"SBOL\"","\"Search\"","\"SynBioHub\""],"title":"SynBioHub: A Standards-Enabled Design Repository for Synthetic Biology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leandro H.

However, more complex models require the coupling of multiple formalisms since different biological concepts are better described using different methods, e.g., stationary metabolism is often modeled using flux-balance analysis (FBA) whereas dynamic changes of model components are better described via ODEs. The coupling of FBA and ODE frameworks results in dynamic FBA models. A major challenge is how to describe such hybrid models coupling multiple frameworks in a standardized way, so that they can be exchanged between tools and simulated consistently and in a reproducible manner.$$Results$$ $$This paper presents a scheme and implementation for encoding dynamic FBA models in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), thereby allowing to exchange multi-framework computational models between software tools. The paper shows the feasibility of the approach using various example models and demonstrates that different tools are able to simulate the hybrid models and agree on the results. As part of this work, two independent implementations of a multi-framework simulation method for dynamic FBA have been developed supporting such models: iBioSim and sbmlutils.$$Availability$$ $$All materials and models are available from https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/dfba.

They enable researchers and practitioners to transport information reliably, to apply a variety of tools to their problems, and to reproduce scientific results. Over the past two decades, a range of standards have been developed to facilitate the exchange and reuse of information in the domain of representation and modeling of biological systems. These standards are complementary, so the interactions between their developers increased over time. By the end of the last decade, the community of researchers decided that more interoperability is required between the standards, and that common development is needed to make better use of effort, time, and money devoted to this activity. The COmputational MOdeling in Biology NEtwork (COMBINE) was created to enable the sharing of resources, tools, and other infrastructure.

In addition to standardizing a format for encoding data, data standards allow for data to be exchanged easily and meaningfully. Standards, commonly, enable applications to easily communicate and pass data to one another; however, this seamless communication between applications is impossible if applications rely on different data standards that encode data differently. This thesis proposes a workflow methodology for best-effort automatic conversion or translation of meta-data from one data standard to another while minimizing the loss of data. The objective of the methodology is to validate the conversion and determine the compatibility between two tools and their underlying data standards. The standard-enabled workflow and methodology created should analyze a given workflow of tools to see if data is lost within the workflow and ensure that the data is still compliant with a standard as the data flows through various tools. To determine how well the methodology works, Synthetic Biology tools are evaluated to see valid connections can be made with other tools while maintaining compliance within the data standard supported by the tool.","tags":[],"title":"Software Compliance Testing for the Synthetic Biology Open Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zach Zundel","Meher Samineni","Zhen Zhang","Chris J.

Analog and digital parts are closely inter-mixed, hence demanding AMS design methods and tools to be more holistic. In particular, the emergence of ``little digital'' electronics inside or near analog circuitry calls for the increasing use of asynchronous logic. To cope with the growing complexity of AMS designs, formal methods are required to complement traditional simulation approaches.

Although SBML has been successful in representing a wide variety of biochemical models, the core standard lacks the structure for representing large complex regular systems in a standard way, such as whole-cell and cellular population models. These models require a large number of variables to represent certain aspects of these types of models, such as the chromosome in the whole-cell model and the many identical cell models in a cellular population. While SBML core is not designed to handle these types of models efficiently, the proposed SBML arrays package can represent such regular structures more easily. However, in order to take full advantage of the package, analysis needs to be aware of the arrays structure. When expanding the array constructs within a model, some of the advantages of using arrays are lost. This paper describes a more efficient way to simulate arrayed models. To illustrate the proposed method, this paper uses a population of repressilator and genetic toggle switch circuits as examples.

The motivating example for this dissertation is the use of fault- tolerant routing protocol for a Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture that connects electronic control units (Ecus) to regulate sensors and actuators in a vehicle. With a network allowing Ecus to communicate with each other, it is possible for them to share processing power to improve performance. In addition, networked Ecus enable flexible mapping to physical processes (e.g., sensors, actuators), which increases resilience to Ecu failures by reassigning physical processes to spare Ecus. For the on-chip routing protocol, the ability to tolerate network faults is important for hardware reconfiguration to maintain the normal operation of a system. Adding a fault-tolerance feature in a routing protocol, however, increases its design complexity, making it prone to many functional problems. Formal verification techniques are therefore needed to verify its correctness. This dissertation proposes a link-fault-tolerant, multiflit wormhole routing algorithm, and its formal modeling and verification using two different methodologies. An improvement upon the previously published fault-tolerant routing algorithm, a link-fault routing algorithm is proposed to relax the unrealistic node-fault assumptions of these algorithms, while avoiding deadlock conservatively by appropriately dropping network packets. This routing algorithm, together with its routing architecture, is then modeled in a process-algebra language LNT, and compositional verification techniques are used to verify its key functional properties. As a comparison, it is modeled using channel-level VHDL which is compiled to labeled Petri-nets (LPNs). Algorithms for a partial order reduction method on LPNs are given. An optimal result is obtained from heuristics that trace back on LPNs to find causally related enabled predecessor transitions. Key observations are made from the comparison between these two verification methodologies.","tags":[],"title":"Verification Methodologies for Fault-Tolerant Network-on-Chip Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris J.

When designing and analyzing genetic circuits, researchers are often interested in the probability of observing certain behaviors. Discerning these probabilities typically involves simulating the circuit to produce some time series data and computing statistics over the resulting data. However, for very rare behaviors of complex genetic circuits, it becomes computationally intractable to obtain good results as the number of required simulation runs grows exponentially. It is, therefore, necessary to apply numerical methods to determine these probabilities directly. This article describes how stochastic model checking, a method for determining the likelihood that certain events occur in a system, can by applied to models of genetic circuits by translating them into continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and analyzing them using Markov chain analysis to check continuous stochastic logic (CSL) properties. The utility of this approach is demonstrated with several case studies illustrating how this method can be used to perform design space exploration of two genetic oscillators and two genetic state-holding elements. Our results show that this method results in a substantial speedup as compared with conventional simulation-based approaches.","tags":["\"design space exploration\"","\"genetic circuit\"","\"Markov chain analysis\"","\"Search\"","\"stochastic logic\"","\"stochastic model checking\"","\"synthetic genetic circuits\""],"title":"Stochastic Model Checking of Genetic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Rodriguez","Alex Thomas","Leandro Watanabe","Ibrahim Y.

Digital technologies have been successful in meeting this challenge, but analog circuits have lagged behind due to smaller transistor sizes having a disproportionate negative affect. Since many applications require small, low-power analog circuits, the trend has been to take advantage of digital's ability to scale by replacing as much of the analog circuitry as possible with digital counterparts. The results are known as  emphdigitally-intensive analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. Though such circuits have helped the scaling problem, they have further complicated verification. This dissertation improves on techniques for AMS property specifications, as well as, develops sound, efficient extensions to formal AMS verification methods. With the  emphlanguage for analog/mixed-signal properties (LAMP), one has a simple intuitive language for specifying AMS properties. LAMP provides a more procedural method for describing properties that is more straightforward than temporal logic-like languages. However, LAMP is still a nascent language and is limited in the types of properties it is capable of describing. This dissertation extends LAMP by adding statements to ignore transient periods and be able to reset the property check when the environment conditions change. After specifying a property, one needs to verify that the circuit satisfies the property. An efficient method for formally verifying AMS circuits is to use the restricted polyhedral class of  emphzones. Zones have simple operations for exploring the reachable state space, but they are only applicable to circuit models that utilize constant rates. To extend zones to more general models, this dissertation provides the theory and implementation needed to soundly handle models with ranges of rates. As a second improvement to the state representation, this dissertation describes how octagons can be adapted to model checking AMS circuit models. Though zones have efficient algorithms, it comes at a cost of over-approximating the reachable state space. Octagons have similarly efficient algorithms while adding additional flexibility to reduce the necessary over-approximations. Finally, the full methodology described in this dissertation is demonstrated on two examples. The first example is a switched capacitor integrator that has been studied in the context of transforming the original formal model to use only single rate assignments. Th property of not saturating is written in LAMP, the circuit is learned, and the property is checked against a faulty and correct circuit. In addition, it is shown that the zone extension, and its implementation with octagons, recovers all previous conclusions with the switched capacitor integrator without the need to translate the model. In particular, the method applies generally to all the models produced and does not require the soundness check needed by the translational approach to accept positive verification results. As a second example, the full tool flow is demonstrated on a digital C-element that is driven by a pair of RC networks, creating an AMS circuit. The RC networks are chosen so that the inputs to the C-element are ordered. LAMP is used to codify this behavior and it is verified that the input signals change in the correct order for the provided SPICE simulation traces.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient, Sound Formal Verification for Analog/Mixed-Signal Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas Roehner","Zhen Zhang","Tramy Nguyen","Chris J.

The state space reductions used in this framework result in a reduced model that contains the exact same set of observably equivalent executions as in the original model, therefore, no false counter-examples result from the verification of the reduced model.

The SBML Hierarchical Model Composition package for SBML Level 3 adds the necessary features to SBML to support hierarchical modeling. The package enables a modeler to include submodels within an enclosing SBML model, delete unneeded or redundant elements of that submodel, replace elements of that submodel with element of the containing model, and replace elements of the containing model with elements of the submodel. In addition, the package defines an optional ``port'' construct, allowing a model to be defined with suggested interfaces between hierarchical components; modelers can chose to use these interfaces, but they are not required to do so and can still interact directly with model elements if they so chose. Finally, the SBML Hierarchical Model Composition package is defined in such a way that a hierarchical model can be ``flattened'' to an equivalent, non-hierarchical version that uses only plain SBML constructs, thus enabling software tools that do not yet support hierarchy to nevertheless work with SBML hierarchical models.","tags":[],"title":"SBML Level 3 Package: Hierarchical Model Composition, Version 1 Release 3","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Falk Schreiber","Gary D.

From nuts and bolts to electronic devices and technological processes, standardised products and processes are all around us. Standards have technological and economic benefits, such as making information exchange, production, and services more efficient. However, novel, innovative areas often either lack proper standards, or documents about standards in these areas are not available from a centralised platform or formal body (such as the International Standardisation Organisation).$$Systems and synthetic biology is a relatively novel area, and it is only in the last decade that the standardisation of data, information, and models related to systems and synthetic biology has become a community-wide effort. Several open standards have been established and are under continuous development as a community initiative. COMBINE, the `COmputational Modeling in BIology' NEtwork [1] has been established as an umbrella initiative to coordinate and promote the development of the various community standards and formats for computational models. There are yearly two meeting, HARMONY (Hackathons on Resources for Modeling in Biology), Hackathon-type meetings with a focus on development of the support for standards, and COMBINE forums, workshop-style events with oral presentations, discussion, poster, and breakout sessions for further developing the standards. For more information see http://co.mbine.org/. So far the different standards were published and made accessible through the standards' web-pages or preprint services. The aim of this special issue is to provide a single, easily accessible and citable platform for the publication of standards in systems and synthetic biology.

This dissertation explores two engineering strategies to address the challenges of working with genetic technology, namely the development of standards for describing genetic components and circuits at separate yet connected levels of detail and the use of Genetic Design Automation (GDA) software tools to simplify and speed up the process of optimally designing genetic circuits. Its contributions to the field of synthetic biology include (1) a proposal for the next version of the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), an existing standard for specifying and exchanging genetic designs electronically, and (2) a GDA work ow that enables users of the software tool iBioSim to create an abstract functional specication, automatically select genetic components that satisfy the specication from a design library, and compose the selected components into a standardized genetic circuit design for subsequent analysis and physical construction. Ultimately, this dissertation demonstrates how existing techniques and concepts from electrical and computer engineering can be adapted to overcome the challenges of genetic design and is an example of what is possible when working with publicly available standards for genetic design.","tags":["\"iBioSim\"","\"SBOL\""],"title":"Technology Mapping of Genetic Circuit Designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhen Zhang","Wendelin Serwe","Jian Wu","Tomohiro Yoneda","Hao Zheng","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1409529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236513,"objectID":"9e769d3c632ec0284fe001f0f45d28b9","permalink":"/publication/formal-analysis-fault-tolerant-zhang-2014/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:44.996733Z","relpermalink":"/publication/formal-analysis-fault-tolerant-zhang-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"A fault-tolerant routing algorithm in Network-on-Chip architectures provides adaptivity for on-chip communications.

This paper performs formal analysis on an extension of the link-fault tolerant Network-on-Chip architecture introduced by Wu et al that supports multiflit wormhole routing.

To this end, we have developed a genetic technology mapping algorithm that builds on the directed acyclic graph (DAG) based mapping techniques originally used to select parts for digital electronic circuit designs and implemented it in our GDA tool, iBioSim. It is among the first genetic technology mapping algorithms to adapt techniques from electronic circuit design, in particular the use of a cost function to guide the search for an optimal solution, and perhaps that which makes the greatest use of standards for describing genetic function and structure to represent design specifications and component libraries. This paper demonstrates the use of our algorithm to map the specifications for three different genetic circuits against four randomly generated libraries of increasing size to evaluate its performance against both exhaustive search and greedy variants for finding optimal and near-optimal solutions.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"iBioSim\"","\"Search\""],"title":"Directed Acyclic Graph-Based Technology Mapping of Genetic Circuit Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew N.

The success of these projects, however, has often failed in translation and application to new projects, a problem exacerbated by a lack of engineering standards that combine descriptions of the structure and function of DNA. To address this need, this paper describes a methodology to connect the systems biology markup language (SBML) to the synthetic biology open language (SBOL), existing standards that describe biochemical models and DNA components, respectively. Our methodology involves first annotating SBML model elements such as species and reactions with SBOL DNA components. A graph is then constructed from the model, with vertices corresponding to elements within the model and edges corresponding to the cause-and-effect relationships between these elements. Lastly, the graph is traversed to assemble the annotating DNA components into a composite DNA component, which is used to annotate the model itself and can be referenced by other composite models and DNA components. In this way, our methodology can be used to build up a hierarchical library of models annotated with DNA components. Such a library is a useful input to any future genetic technology mapping algorithm that would automate the process of composing DNA components to satisfy a behavioral specification. Our methodology for SBML-to-SBOL annotation is implemented in the latest version of our genetic design automation (GDA) software tool, iBioSim.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"iBioSim\"","\"SBOL\""],"title":"A Methodology to Annotate Systems Biology Markup Language Models with the Synthetic Biology Open Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leandro H.

Synthetic biology combines the research of biology with the engineering principles of standards, abstraction, and automated construction with the ultimate goal of being able to design and build useful biological systems. To realize this goal, researchers are actively working on better ways to model and analyze synthetic genetic circuits, groupings of genes that influence the expression of each other through the use of proteins. When designing and analyzing genetic circuits, researchers are often interested in building circuits that exhibit a particular behavior. Usually, this involves simulating their models to produce some time series data and analyzing this data to discern whether or not the circuit behaves appropriately. This method becomes less attractive as circuits grow in complexity because it becomes very time consuming to generate a sufficient amount of runs for analysis. In addition, trying to select representative runs out of a large data set is tedious and error-prone thereby motivating methods of automating this analysis. This has led to the need for design space exploration techniques that allow synthetic biologists to easily explore the effect of varying parameters and efficiently consider alternative designs of their systems. This dissertation attempts to address this need by proposing new analysis and verification techniques for synthetic genetic circuits. In particular, it applies formal methods such as model checking techniques to models of genetic circuits in order to ensure that they behave correctly and are as robust as possible for a variety of different inputs and/or parameter settings. However, model checking stochastic systems is not as simple as model checking deterministic systems where it is always known what the next state of the system will be at any given step. Stochastic systems can exhibit a variety of different behaviors that are chosen randomly with different probabilities at each time step. Therefore, model checking a stochastic system involves calculating the probability that the system will exhibit a desired behavior. Although it is often more difficult to work with the probabilities that stochastic systems introduce, stochastic systems and the models that represent them are becoming commonplace in many disciplines including electronic circuit design where as parts are being made smaller and smaller, they are becoming less reliable. In addition to stochastic model checking, this dissertation proposes a new incremental stochastic simulation algorithm (iSSA) based on Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) that is capable of presenting a researcher with a simulation trace of the typical behavior of the system. Before the development of this algorithm, discerning this information was extremely error-prone as it involved performing many simulations and attempting to wade through the massive amounts of data. This algorithm greatly aids researchers in designing genetic circuits as it efficiently shows the researcher the most likely behavior of the circuit. Both the iSSA and stochastic model checking can be used in concert to give a researcher the likelihood that the system will exhibit its most typical behavior. Once the typical behavior is known, properties for nontypical behaviors can be constructed and their likelihoods can also be computed. This methodology is applied to several genetic circuits leading to new understanding of the effects of various parameters on the behavior of these circuits.","tags":["\"Search\"","\"stochastic logic\""],"title":"Stochastic Analysis of Synthetic Genetic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason T.

To address this problem, this paper employs the use of stochastic model checking, a method for determining the likelihood that certain events occur in a system, with continuous stochastic logic (CSL) properties to obtain similar results. This goal is accomplished by the introduction of a methodology for converting a genetic circuit model (GCM) into a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). This CTMC is analyzed using transient Markov chain analysis to determine the likelihood that the circuit satisfies a given CSL property in a finite amount of time. This paper illustrates a use of this methodology to determine the likelihood of failure in a genetic toggle switch and compares these results to stochastic simulation-based analysis of this same circuit.

One of the assumptions made by SCK is that each reaction be an elementary step which cannot be broken down into smaller steps. As such, transition events of the SCK model occur spontaneously in that there is no time lag between the reaction initiation and completion. In practice, however, it is very difficult to experimentally determine if an observed state change is a result of an elementary reaction or a sequence of several reaction steps. To test various hypotheses on such time-delays through the use of the SCK, all of the intermediate reactions and species need to be explicitly specified, which can quickly become cumbersome. To more efficiently model and analyze potential effects of such intermediate reaction steps, this paper proposes a new formalism for higher-level discrete-stochastic treatment of biological systems with reaction delays. Our new formalism can represent a time delay caused by intermediate reaction steps as an Erlang random variable, allowing a model's size to be reduced substantially. This paper illustrates an application of this formalism for analysis of the effect of different transcription elongation steps and rates on the distribution of RNA molecules.","tags":["\"stochastic logic\""],"title":"Erlang-Delayed Stochastic Chemical Kinetic Formalism for Efficient Analysis of Biological Systems with Non-Elementary Reaction Effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kevin Jones"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1304208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236488,"objectID":"91d0532e081bced316e7d28e15d682de","permalink":"/publication/automated-abstraction-labeled-jones-2011/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:36.729388Z","relpermalink":"/publication/automated-abstraction-labeled-jones-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the increasing use and complexity of embedded and cyber-physical systems, proper validation of these systems is an increasingly important topic.

This information can be used to understand the genetic regulatory network that generates the data. Typically, Bayesian analysis approaches are applied which neglect the time series nature of the experimental data, have difficulty in determining the direction of causality, and do not perform well on networks with tight feedback. To address these problems, this paper presents a method to learn genetic network connectivity which exploits the time series nature of experimental data to achieve better causal predictions. This method first breaks up the data into bins. Next, it determines an initial set of potential influence vectors for each gene based upon the probability of the gene's expression increasing in the next time step. These vectors are then combined to form new vectors with better scores. Finally, these influence vectors are competed against each other to determine the final influence vector for each gene.

In order to assist functional verification of  complex AMS system-on-chips (SoCs), there is a need to represent the transistor-level circuits in the form of abstract models. The ability to represent the analog circuits as behavioral models is necessary, but not sufficient. Though there exist languages like Verilog-AMS and VHDL-AMS for modeling AMS circuits, there is no easy method for generating these models directly from the transistor-level descriptions. This thesis presents an improved method for extracting behavioral models from the simulations of AMS circuits. This method generates labeled Petri net (LPN) models that can be used in the formal verification of circuits, and SystemVerilog models that can be used in the system-level simulations.","tags":[],"title":"Automatic Extraction of Behavioral Models from Simulations of Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiroyuki Kuwahara","Curtis Madsen","Ivan Mura","Chris Myers","Abiezer Tejeda","Chris Winstead"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1280620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236506,"objectID":"9a7226ef8f1c523e22714bfdd44ba205","permalink":"/publication/effecient-stochastic-simulation-kuwahara-2010/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:42.598814Z","relpermalink":"/publication/effecient-stochastic-simulation-kuwahara-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Open access peer-reviewed chapter","tags":["\"stochastic logic\""],"title":"Effecient Stochastic Simulation to Analyze Targeted Properties of Biological Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiroyuki Kuwahara","Curtis Madsen","Ivan Mura","Chris Myers","Abiezer Tejeda","Chris Winstead"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1280620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610731560,"objectID":"c6f40b2b31e2dfa65df62507a8fe7daa","permalink":"/publication/kuwahara-effecient-2010/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:26:00.842676Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kuwahara-effecient-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Open access peer-reviewed chapter","tags":["stochastic logic"],"title":"Effecient Stochastic Simulation to Analyze Targeted Properties of Biological Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1280620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610731560,"objectID":"b8635892ef6c4a03af59e8d6d08d6bde","permalink":"/publication/myers-stochastic-2010/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:26:00.605141Z","relpermalink":"/publication/myers-stochastic-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Uncertainty presents significant challenges in the reasoning about and controlling of complex dynamical systems.

The Muller C-element is a standard logic gate commonly used to synchronize independent processes in most asynchronous electronic circuits. Synthetic biological logic gates have been previously demonstrated, but there remain many open issues in the design of sequential (state-holding) logic operations. Three designs are considered for the genetic Muller C-element: a majority gate, a toggle switch, and a speed-independent implementation. While the three designs are logically equivalent, each design requires different assumptions to operate correctly. The majority gate design requires the most timing assumptions, the speed-independent design requires the least, and the toggle switch design is a compromise between the two. This paper examines the robustness of these designs as well as the effects of parameter variation using stochastic simulation. The results show that robustness to timing assumptions does not necessarily increase reliability, suggesting that modifications to existing logic design tools are going to be necessary for synthetic biology. Parameter variation simulations yield further insights into the design principles necessary for building robust genetic gates. The results suggest that high gene count, cooperativity of at least two, tight repression, and balanced decay rates are necessary for robust gates. Finally, this paper presents a potential application of the genetic Muller C-element as a quorum-mediated trigger.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"stochastic logic\"","\"synthetic logic gate\""],"title":"Design and Analysis of a Robust Genetic Muller C-Element","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Winstead","Curtis Madsen","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1272672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236523,"objectID":"9d7a30c22eb4e682d90ca00f04c37243","permalink":"/publication/issa-incremental-stochastic-winstead-2010/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:48.581854Z","relpermalink":"/publication/issa-incremental-stochastic-winstead-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Researchers are now developing synthetic genetic circuits to manipulate the biochemical processes within living cells.

A key UPEC molecular virulence mechanism is type 1 fimbriae, whose expression is controlled by the orientation of an invertible chromosomal DNA element— the fim switch. Temperature has been shown to act as a major regulator of fim switching behavior and is overall an important indicator as well as functional feature of many urologic diseases, including UPEC host-pathogen interaction dynamics. Given this panoptic physiological role of temperature during UTI progression and notable empirical challenges to its direct in vivo studies, in silico modeling of corresponding biochemical and biophysical mechanisms essential to UPEC pathogenicity may significantly aid our understanding of the underlying disease processes. However, rigorous computational analysis of biological systems, such as fim switch temperature control circuit, has hereto presented a notoriously demanding problem due to both the substantial complexity of the gene regulatory networks involved as well as their often characteristically discrete and stochastic dynamics. To address these issues, we have developed an approach that enables automated multiscale abstraction of biological system descriptions based on reaction kinetics. Implemented as a computational tool, this method has allowed us to efficiently analyze the modular organization and behavior of the E. coli fimbriation switch circuit at different temperature settings, thus facilitating new insights into this mode of UPEC molecular virulence regulation. In particular, our results suggest that, with respect to its role in shutting down fimbriae expression, the primary function of FimB recombinase may be to effect a controlled down-regulation (rather than increase) of the ON-to-OFF fim switching rate via temperature-dependent suppression of competing dynamics mediated by recombinase FimE. Our computational analysis further implies that this down-regulation mechanism could be particularly significant inside the host environment, thus potentially contributing further understanding toward the development of novel therapeutic approaches to UPEC-caused UTIs.","tags":["\"electrical circuit\"","\"genetic circuit\"","\"logic circuits\"","\"simulation and modeling\"","\"stochastic logic\"","\"synthetic genetic networks\"","\"virulence factors\""],"title":"Temperature Control of Fimbriation Circuit Switch in Uropathogenic Escherichia Coli: Quantitative Analysis via Automated Model Abstraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiroyuki Kuwahara","Chris J.

Also, iBioSim now includes the LHPN file type in its file tree so users can view and edit LHPNs once conversion is complete.

This methodology has worked successfully for many years, but process variation and design complexity are prompting designers to explore new techniques. Formal methods are being used successfully to aid in the complex validation problem for digital circuits. This dissertation presents formal methods for analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. This dissertation describes the development of a formal model, labeled hybrid Petri nets (LHPNs), appropriate for the modeling and verification of AMS circuits. An LHPN is a Petri net variant capable of modeling both continuous and discrete quantities. Creating an LHPN model of an AMS circuit by hand is a complicated and error prone exercise that requires expert knowledge. This is unacceptable for practical adoption of the LHPN model and its associated analysis methods. For this reason, this dissertation introduces an automatic LHPN model generation method. The method uses a set of simulation traces and a desired system property to generate an LHPN modeling the behavior of the simulation traces. The model generator can also be used to generate abstract Verilog-AMS or VHDL-AMS models suitable for use in system-level simulations.  Formal verification of a property over the entire state space of an LHPN model is complicated by the infinite state of the model. For this reason, the infinite states of the model are grouped into potentially finite groups of equivalent states for verification. Difference bound matrices (DBMs), a restricted form of convex polygons, are used to represent these equivalent classes of infinite states. Reachability analysis using DBMs is very efficient at the cost of exactness. This dissertation presents algorithms for conservative state space analysis and verification of LHPNs. Finally, these methods are demonstrated on several case studies of AMS circuits from both academia and industry. The formal verification methods demonstrate the ability to find bugs missed by standard simulations.

Analysis of these circuits is also performed at this very low level. This thesis presents a first step at developing a GDA tool that supports higher levels of abstraction. In particular, this thesis describes the Genetic Circuit Model (GCM), a graphical specification language from which molecular descriptions can be synthesized. The GCM has several advantages. The input is tightly controlled through the use of an editor, limiting the possibility of user error. The representation of the genetic circuit is much more compact than using the System Biology Markup Language (SBML), the standard form for representing genetics circuits. The GCM can be automatically translated into SBML, allowing GCM's to be easily simulated across multiple different simulators. The GCM to SBML translation process is targeted in such a way that the resulting output can be easily abstracted to allow for efficient simulation.  To evaluate and test the GCM, this thesis presents a case study of the design of a genetic Muller C-element, a gate often used in asynchronous design. Three different genetic Muller C-elements are designed and analyzed. The utility of the GCM is demonstrated as it allows for efficient analysis of the Muller C-elements. The results of the simulations show that logically equivalent circuits can have different behaviors. In particular, a speed independent Muller C-element does not necessary imply that the gate is more robust than a non-speed independent gate. Design principles gathered from the simulations are that dual-rail outputs are essential, high gene count increases robustness, cooperativity greater than one is necessary, repression needs to be strong, and decay rates must be balanced for high robustness and low switching time. One potential application of the genetic Muller C-element is determining when to start the invasion of cancer cells. The two input signals are an environmental signal, and a communication signal. Using these signals, the bacteria colony can correctly reach consensus on when to begin the invasion. One interesting result is that noise is necessary in correctly switching into the invasion state.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\""],"title":"Design and Analysis of Genetic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott Little","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1214870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236476,"objectID":"15a7b80b5062ce097bb8be37e05e8127","permalink":"/publication/abstract-modeling-simulation-little-2008/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:33.611882Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abstract-modeling-simulation-little-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract.

This information can be used to understand the genetic regulatory network that generates the data. Typically, Bayesian analysis approaches are applied which neglect the time series nature of the experimental data, have difficulty in determining the direction of causality, and do not perform well on networks with tight feedback. To address these problems, this dissertation presents an improved method, called the GeneNet algorithm, to learn genetic regulatory network connectivity which exploits the time series nature of experimental data to allow for better causal predictions on networks with tight feedback. More specifically, the GeneNet algorithm provides several contributions to the area of genetic network discovery. It finds networks with cyclic or tight feedback behavior often missed by other methods as it performs a more local analysis of the data. It provides the researcher with the ability to see the interactions between genes in a genetic network. It guides experimental design by providing feedback to the researcher as to which parts of the network are the most unclear. It is encased in an infrastructure that allows for rapid genetic network model creation and evaluation. The GeneNet algorithm first encodes the data into levels. Next, it determines an initial set of influence vectors for each species based upon the probability of the species' expression increasing. From this set of influence vectors, it determines if any influence vectors should be merged, representing a combined effect. Finally, influence vectors are competed against each other to obtain the best influence vector. The result is a directed graph representation of the genetic network's repression and activation connections. Results are reported for several synthetic networks showing significant improvements in both recall and runtime while performing nearly as well or better in precision over a dynamic Bayesian approach.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"Search\""],"title":"Learning Genetic Regulatory Network Connectivity from Time Series Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hiroyuki Kuwahara"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1196467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236527,"objectID":"ecfa8e548a8c3221855a8a043d331215","permalink":"/publication/model-abstraction-temporal-kuwahara-2007/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:50.226407Z","relpermalink":"/publication/model-abstraction-temporal-kuwahara-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"With advances in technologies such as high throughput data collection and genome sequencing methods, the Human Genome Project which, among other things, determined the human DNA sequence and identified all the genes in human DNA was completed at least two years ahead of time. As these technologies are becoming more accurate, efficient, and cost effective and a massive amount of genomic and proteomic data are becoming available at a rapid pace, we are now in the position to face the challenge to understand how these genes coupled with environmental stimuli orchestrate the regulation of cell-level behaviors. However, understanding such complex systems is very expensive and is most likely impractical with wet-lab experiments alone as the amount and the complexity of data substantially increase, requiring the integration of computational methods to make the process more efficient. To allow for substantial acceleration in computational analysis, this dissertation develops a model abstraction methodology for biochemical systems which systematically performs various model abstractions to reduce the complexity of computational biochemical models. Our methodology is particularly useful for systems with small molecular counts that require the discrete and stochastic representation and thus demand substantial computational requirements. As a case study, this dissertation illustrates the application of individual abstraction methods to such systems. Furthermore, it demonstrates the application of collective abstraction methods at various accuracy levels to temporal behavior analysis of several genetic regulatory networks. This dissertation shows that analysis time of biologically relevant properties of such genetic regulatory networks can be improved from days of work to minutes of work using our methodology while maintaining reasonable accuracy.","tags":["\"genetic circuit\"","\"stochastic logic\""],"title":"Model Abstraction and Temporal Behavior Analysis of Genetic Regulatory Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

This has led to a substantial interest in the formal verification of digital components. There has been relatively little research, however, into the application of formal verification methods to the analog/mixed-signal domain. Therefore, the overall goal of this work is to provide a system for efficient and meaningful analysis of analog/mixed-signal circuits. This encompasses two major efforts: modeling and symbolic analysis. The continuous nature of analog circuits requires a modeling method that is capable of representing continuous behavior and the discrete nature of digital circuits requires a modeling method that is capable of representing discrete behavior. This dual requirement necessitates a hybrid model— a model that can simultaneously represent continuous and discrete behavior. This work details the development of a specialized hybrid Petri net model with capabilities similar to hybrid automata.  Analysis is greatly complicated by the addition of continuous behavior to the model. To help alleviate this, infinite numbers of states are often grouped into equivalence classes represented by symbolic structures. The analysis methods described here represent ranges of continuous variables using groups of inequalities which are then either mapped to Binary Decision Diagram variables so that necessary operations can be performed efficiently, or handed over to an advanced Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver for analysis. After describing the verification system in detail, experiences applying the techniques to several case studies are described and performance results are provided.","tags":["\"Search\""],"title":"Verification of Analog and Mixed-Signal Circuits Using Symbolic Methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Frederic Beal","Tomohiro Yoneda","Chris J.

Furthermore, an ability to change the level of abstraction can be very useful when dealing with many biological systems, including gene regulatory networks. These systems typically have too many components and states to be practically studied using all-inclusive low-level models, yet they often manifest enough dynamical and functional complexity, making an entirely high-level qualitative representation similarly inadequate — thus necessitating a search for some intermediate level of abstraction. Finally, while most abstractions used in modeling of biochemical networks have traditionally been performed manually, doing so accurately in a large system is a tedious and time-consuming process that is highly susceptible to errors during model transformation. To address these issues, we have developed a methodology and implemented an automated modeling and analysis tool with variable abstraction level capabilities. In this paper, we use it for the analysis of switching in Type 1 pili expression dynamics and, in particular, for the problem of estimating the effect of H-NS and Lrp regulatory protein levels on phase variation rates in E. coli. Such behavior is notoriously difficult to study due to the size of the associated gene regulatory network and the characteristically stochastic dynamics involved, which result in very high analytical and computational demands. Here, we show how, by using our system, we are able to automatically abstract the switch network and accurately predict E. coli afimbriation rates, while, at the same time, accelerating the required computations by up to two orders of magnitude.

In order to efficiently analyze a large scale system in an automated and objective manner, abstraction is essential. This paper presents an automated abstraction methodology that systematically reduces the small scale complexity found in genetic regulatory network models, while broadly preserving the large scale system behavior. Our approach is to first reduce the number of reactions through a quasisteady-state approximation-based algorithm. Second, it represents the exact molecular state of the system by a set of reduced Boolean (or nary) discrete levels. This results in a chemical master equation that is approximated by a Markov chain with a much smaller state space providing significant simulation time acceleration and computability gains. 1 Background Numerous methods have been proposed to model genetic regulatory networks [1, 2]. While many traditional approaches have relied on a differential equation representation as inferred from a set of underlying biochemical reactions, there has been a growing appreciation of their limitations [3-6]. In particular, differential equation analysis of genetic networks generally assumes that the number of molecules in a cell is high and their concentrations can be viewed as continuous quantities, while their underlying reactions occur deterministically. However, in natural genetic networks these assumptions frequently do not hold as, for example, DNA molecules are typically present in single digit quantities, while some promoters can lead to substantial fluctuations in transcription/translation rates and essentially non-deterministic expression characteristics [7, 8].","tags":["\"genetic circuit\""],"title":"Asynchronous Abstraction Methodology for Genetic Regulatory Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Technology-mapping combines the steps of decomposition, partitioning, and matching/covering to implement a synthesized design in a given technology. This work is applied to timed circuits, which are a class of asynchronous circuits that utilize explicit timing information for optimization throughout the entire design process. This work carries the timing constraints down to the circuit implementation level, giving new insight into the detection and elimination of hazards. In asynchronous circuits, correct operation requires that there are no hazards in the circuit implementation. Therefore, each internal node and output of the transformed circuit following decomposition must be verified for hazard-freedom to ensure correct operation. Current verification algorithms require an explicit state exploration often resulting in state explosion for even modest sized examples. The goal of the hazard verification portion of technology-mapping is to abstract the behavior of internal nodes and utilize the reduced state space to make a conservative determination of hazard-freedom for each node in the circuit. The newly annotated circuit is then mapped to an existing library for implementation. This dissertation explores various complexities of libraries used for matching and examines the hazard covering behavior using a variety of gates. Issues such as short-circuit detection and common-input matching are explored in detail, particularly when libraries contain generalized C-elements. The goal of this research is a hazard-free implementation of the synthesized design in a user-provided technology. Experimental results indicate that this new hazard-verification approach is substantially more efficient than existing timing verification tools and that in most cases hazard-free netlists are produced with modest sized libraries.","tags":["\"Search\""],"title":"Technology Mapping of Timed Asynchronous Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Denduang Pradubsuwun","Tomohiro Yoneda","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1099267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236533,"objectID":"f0ee82b2714f1134a3d6e3074b3834b7","permalink":"/publication/partial-order-reduction-pradubsuwun-2004/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:52.497608Z","relpermalink":"/publication/partial-order-reduction-pradubsuwun-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a partial order reduction algorithm for timed trace theoretic verification in order to detect both safety failures and timing failures of timed circuits efficiently.

Timed asynchronous systems differ from untimed, speed independent systems in that any change to the system or its timing may dramatically affect the reachable state space. Because frequent state space exploration is time consuming, timing information is used in a variety of ways to postpone or eliminate state space explorations. First, timing information is used to predict the impact of a state signal on the overall system. Second, concurrency information is used to narrow the search space to timing-unique solutions. Third, timing information allows state signal insertion in a timing-sequential, yet noncausal, manner. This permits insertion before input events, an option not readily available in speed-independent systems. Finally, by considering timing, state signal insertion points can be chosen which minimally increase circuit latency. The method has been implemented in the automated design tool ATACS, and correctly and efficiently completes the state code for a variety of established state coding benchmark systems.","tags":["\"ATACS\"","\"ATACS design tool\"","\"Search\""],"title":"Complete State Coding of Timed Asynchronous Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric Mercer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1038700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236500,"objectID":"da14815c43f6a03d11c8b6ec7dde90f2","permalink":"/publication/correctness-reduction-timed-mercer-2002/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:40.648831Z","relpermalink":"/publication/correctness-reduction-timed-mercer-2002/","section":"publication","summary":"To increase performance, circuit designers are experimenting with timed circuits a class of circuits that rely on a complex set of timing constraints for correct functionality. This is evidenced in published experimental designs from industry. Timing constraints are key to the success of these designs, and algorithms to verify timing constraints are required to make them practical in commercial applications. Due to the complexity of the constraints, however, traditional static timing analysis is not adequate. Timed state space analysis is required; thus, improved timed state space analysis is paramount to producing efficient timed circuits.  This dissertation discusses two facets of work in timed state space analysis: correctness and reduction. For correctness, this dissertation presents the level ruled Petri net as a model for timed circuits. This model is based on the Petri net language. It includes, however, timing information and level expressions that are key to the specification and verification of timed circuits. This dissertation formalizes the intent of correctness in the verification of a timed circuit by defining a set of failure conditions that can be analyzed in the circuit's respective model. The circuit is said to be correct if its model is failure free. For reduction, this dissertation presents a timed state space analysis algorithm that verifies correctness in the timed circuit model. The algorithm, when compared to existing algorithms, reduces on average the running time and memory footprint of analysis. A partial order reduction is implemented for the algorithm to further reduce its resource usage. This reduction is not supported by the existing algorithms; thus, the new analysis algorithm can be applied to systems that are beyond their capacity.

However, the computational complexity of such error control coding schemes is a barrier to implementing them. Recently, researchers have found that bioinspired analog network decoding is a good approach with better combined power/speed performance than its digital counterparts. However, the lack of CAD (computer aided design) tools makes the analog implementation quite time consuming and error prone. Meanwhile, the performance loss due to the nonidealities of the analog circuits has not been systematically analyzed. Also, how to organize analog circuits so that the nonideal effects are minimized has not been discussed. In designing analog error control decoders, simulation is a time-consuming task because the bit error rate is quite low at high SNR (signal to noise ratio), requiring a large number of simulations. By using high-level VHDL simulations, the simulation is done both accurately and efficiently. Many researchers have found that error control decoders can be interpreted as operations of the sum-product algorithm on probability propagation networks, which is a kind of factor graph. Of course, analog error control decoders can also be described at a high-level using factor graphs. As a result, an automatic simulation tool is built. From its high-level factor graph description, the VHDL simulation files for an analog error control decoder can be automatically generated, making the simulation process simple and efficient. After analyzing the factor graph representations of analog error control decoders, we found that analog error control decoders have quite regular structures and can be built by using a small number of basic cells in a cell library, facilitating automatic synthesis. This dissertation also presents the cell library and how to automatically synthesize analog decoders from a factor graph description. All substantial nonideal effects of the analog circuit are also discussed in the dissertation. How to organize the circuit to minimize these effects and make the circuit optimized in a combined consideration of speed, performance, and power is also provided.","tags":["\"Search\""],"title":"Design Methodology for Analog VLSI Implementations of Error Control Decoders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Handshaking expansion includes protocol selection, reshuffling, and state variable insertion. The starting point is a channel-level specification of a design. The goal is a signal-level description of the given design that is correct, synthesizable, and efficient. This dissertation studies the impact of protocol selection and implementation on deadlock avoidance, complete state coding (CSC), CPU time required to compile a given example, and the quality of the circuit. This dissertation treats reshuffling and state-variable insertion as special cases of concurrency reduction. Prior work in the field has also taken this approach. However, this dissertation extends this approach and applies it to specifications that contain quantitative timing assumptions. The concurrency reduction algorithms have been implemented within a computer aided design (CAD) tool. Starting from a signal-level specification that contains the constraints of the desired protocol, these algorithms search the concurrency reduction design space, guided by an estimate of the performance of the final circuit. The CAD tool that this dissertation presents also contains a front end that, given a channel-level specification, produces the starting point for concurrency-reduction. This front end currently handles only pure synchronization channels, using one protocol. Finding all possible ways to reduce concurrency of a specification is a fundamentally exponential problem. However, this dissertation presents techniques to dramatically prune the search space. This dissertation demonstrates that these techniques are capable of reducing the search space by several orders of magnitude compared to the theoretical upper bound – and by one order of magnitude beyond existing techniques – without significantly impacting the quality of the solutions.","tags":["\"Search\""],"title":"Protocol Selection, Implementation, and Analysis for Asynchronous Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomohiro Yoneda","Tomoya Kitai","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1025481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236490,"objectID":"727ed80b05911b002d8705bf4265502d","permalink":"/publication/automatic-derivation-timing-yoneda-2002/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:37.529149Z","relpermalink":"/publication/automatic-derivation-timing-yoneda-2002/","section":"publication","summary":"This work proposes a technique to automatically obtain timing constraints for a given timed circuit to operate correctly. A designated set of delay parameters of a circuit are first set to sufficiently large bounds, and verification runs followed by failure analysis are repeated.

The failure trace is analyzed, and sufficient timing constraints to prevent the failure is obtained.

This process terminates when either some delay bounds under which no failure is detected are found or no new delay bounds to prevent the failures can be obtained.

Locally-clocked modules can be used as synchronous datapath elements in synchronous systems or as asynchronous elements in an asynchronous system. One key element of a locally-clocked module is a stoppable ring oscillator (or stoppable clock). If locally-clocked modules are to be used, their practicality must be quantified. Namely, it must be shown that a reliable and useful stoppable clock can be built. This thesis presents the design and evaluation of a fabricated locally-clocked sequential multiplier. The multiplier is used as a driving example to evaluate local clocks. The design for the stoppable clock is a hybrid of stoppable clocks from previous work. The same gates that make up the critical path of the multiplier are used to make the delay element of the stoppable clock. Although the stoppable clock is meant to track the datapath under a wide range of voltages and temperatures, it is shown that the clock requires tuning to match the critical path sometimes. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to match the critical path exactly. In addition, some temperature and voltage data points cause the cutoff path for the clock to be too slow. This problem is fixed by slowing down the clock. Future designs can focus on speeding up the cutoff path; thus, matching the critical path delay is the only limiting factor on clock frequency. A 20-bit multiplier was fabricated through MOSIS using AMI's 0.5 $μ$m process. The multiplier consumes 0.468 mm2 and contains 8190 transistors. With a 5 volt power supply, the multiplier runs at 13.3 MHz and consumes 196.6 mW of power, while the stoppable clock runs at 174 MHz. This thesis presents latency and power measurements for the multiplier and stoppable clock in addition to a detailed analysis of stoppable clocks. Process variation is analyzed in that five chips are tested and shown to have little variation in measured values.","tags":["\"Search\""],"title":"Analysis and Characterization of a Locally-Clocked Module","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jie Dai","C.J.

Achieving fine grained power down and progressive pipeline stalls at the local stage level is therefore becoming increasingly, important to enable lower dynamic power consumption while keeping introduced switching noise under control as well as avoiding global distribution of timing critical stall signals. It has long been known that the interlocking properties of as asynchronous pipelined systems have a potential to provide such benefits. However it has not been understood how such interlocking can be achieved in synchronous pipelines. This paper presents a novel technique based on local clock gating and synchronous handshake protocols that achieves stage level interlocking characteristics in synchronous pipelines similar to that of asynchronous pipelines. The presented technique is directly applicable to traditional synchronous pipelines and works equally well for two-phase clocked pipelines based on transparent latches, as well as one-phase clocked pipelines based on master-slave latches.","tags":["\"clock\"","\"control system\"","\"Design automation\"","\"dynamic power consumption\"","\"energy consumption\"","\"fine grained power down\"","\"flip-flops\"","\"global distribution\"","\"handshake protocols\"","\"integrated circuit noise\"","\"interlocking characteristics\"","\"Jacobian matrices\"","\"latches\"","\"local clock gating\"","\"local stage level\"","\"locality principles\"","\"low-power electronics\"","\"master-slave latches\"","\"one-phase clocked pipelines\"","\"pipeline processing\"","\"pipelines\"","\"power dissipation\"","\"progressive pipeline stalls\"","\"switching noise\"","\"synchronous interlocked pipelines\"","\"timing\"","\"timing critical stall signals\"","\"transparent latches\"","\"two-phase clocked pipelines\"","\"very high speed integrated circuits\""],"title":"Synchronous Interlocked Pipelines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sung-Tae Jung","C.J.

The synthesis procedure begins with a graph specification with timing constraints. A timing analysis extracts the timed concurrency and timed causality relations directly from the specification. Then, a hazard-free implementation of the specification is synthesized by analyzing precedence graphs which are constructed by using the timed concurrency and timed causality relations. The major result of this work is that the method does not suffer from the state explosion problem, in practice achieves significant reductions in synthesis time for the specifications which have a large state space, and generates synthesized circuits that have nearly the same area as compared to previous timed circuit methods. In particular, this paper shows that a timed circuit-not containing circuit hazards under given timing constraints-can be found by using the relations between signal transitions of the specification. Moreover, the relations can be efficiently found using a heuristic timing analysis algorithm. By allowing significantly larger designs to be synthesized, this work is a step toward the development of high-level synthesis tools for system level asynchronous circuits.","tags":["\"algorithm design and analysis\"","\"asynchronous circuits\"","\"circuit\"","\"circuit synthesis\"","\"concurrency\"","\"direct synthesis\"","\"explosion\"","\"free-choice STG\"","\"graph specification\"","\"hazard-free implementation\"","\"hazards\"","\"hazards and race conditions\"","\"heuristic algorithms\"","\"heuristic timing analysis\"","\"high level synthesis\"","\"high-level synthesis tools\"","\"petri nets\"","\"precedence graphs\"","\"signal synthesis\"","\"signal transition graph\"","\"signal transitions\"","\"state space\"","\"state-space methods\"","\"synthesis time\"","\"timed asynchronous circuits\"","\"timed causality\"","\"timed concurrency\"","\"timing\"","\"timing constraints\""],"title":"Direct Synthesis of Timed Circuits from Free-Choice STGs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bin Zhou","Tomohiro Yoneda","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1004572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236513,"objectID":"e0ae1837ad14e7a2462d2025bdfe1637","permalink":"/publication/framework-timed-trace-zhou-2001/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:45.122427Z","relpermalink":"/publication/framework-timed-trace-zhou-2001/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper develops a framework to support trace theoretic verification of timed circuits and systems.

Circuit correctness in these aggressive styles is highly timing dependent and, in industry, they are typically designed by hand. In order to automate the process of designing and verifying timed circuits, algorithms for their synthesis and verification are necessary. This paper presents timed event/level (TEL) structures, a specification formalism for timed circuits that corresponds directly to gate-level circuits. It also presents an algorithm based on partially ordered sets to make the state-space exploration of TEL structures more tractable. The combination of the new specification method and algorithm significantly improves efficiency for gate-level timing verification. Results on a number of circuits, including many from the recently published gigahertz unit Test Site (guTS) processor from IBM indicate that modules of significant size can be verified using a level of abstraction that preserves the interesting timing properties of the circuit. Accurate circuit level verification allows the designer to include less margin in the design, which can lead to increased performance.","tags":["\"algorithm design and analysis\"","\"asynchronous circuits\"","\"automatic testing\"","\"circuit\"","\"circuit CAD\"","\"circuit synthesis\"","\"circuit testing\"","\"decoding\"","\"delay\"","\"gate-level circuits\"","\"integrated circuit testing\"","\"logic design\"","\"logic gates\"","\"logic testing\"","\"Microprocessors\"","\"partially ordered sets\"","\"performance gain\"","\"process design\"","\"specification formalism\"","\"state-space exploration\"","\"state-space methods\"","\"TEL structures\"","\"timed circuit verification\"","\"timed event/level structures\"","\"timing\"","\"timing properties\"","\"VLSI\""],"title":"Timed Circuit Verification Using TEL Structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris J.

This technique uses timed stochastic Petri nets (TSPN) which support choice and arbitrary delay distributions. The SCP is the delay of the average path in a TSPN when represented as a sum of weighted place delays. A place delay is the expected value of its associated distribution and its weight denotes its importance in the average path of the TSPN. The approach analyzes finite execution traces of the TSPN to derive an expression for the weight values in the SCP. The weights can be analyzed with basic statistics to within an arbitrary error bound. This paper demonstrates the use of the SCP to aggressively optimize timed asynchronous circuits for improved average-case performance by reducing transistor counts, reordering input pins at gates, and skewing transistor sizes to favor important transitions. Each optimization effort is directed to improve the average-case delay in the circuit at the possible expense of the worst-case delay.","tags":["\"asynchronous circuits\"","\"circuit\"","\"circuit analysis\"","\"circuit optimization\"","\"delay\"","\"delay distributions\"","\"Delays\"","\"Error analysis\"","\"Measurement\"","\"optimization\"","\"performance metric\"","\"petri nets\"","\"statistical analysis\"","\"statistical distributions\"","\"stochastic cycle period analysis\"","\"stochastic logic\"","\"stochastic processes\"","\"timed circuits\"","\"timed stochastic petri nets\"","\"weighted place delays\""],"title":"Stochastic Cycle Period Analysis in Timed Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Recent design examples have shown that significant performance gains are realized when aggressive circuit styles are used. Circuit correctness in these aggressive circuit styles is highly timing dependent, and in industry they are typically designed by hand. In order to automate the process of designing and verifying timed circuits, algorithms to explore the reachable state space of the circuit under the timing constraints are necessary. This thesis presents a new specification method for timed circuits, timed event/level (TEL) structures, and new algorithms for exploring a timed state space. The TEL structure specification allows the designer to specify behavior controlled by signal transitions, which is best for representing sequencing, and behavior controlled by signal levels, which is best for representing gate level circuits. This thesis also presents algorithms based on partially ordered sets (POSETs) that explores the timed state space of the TEL structure. Results using the new specification method and algorithms show orders of magnitude improvement over previous techniques in both speed and memory performance. The algorithms have also been successfully applied to several circuit examples from the recently published experimental Gigahertz processor developed at IBM. The speed and memory performance improvements of the algorithm allow automatic synthesis and verification of complex timed circuits, making them an attractive design alternative.","tags":["\"Search\""],"title":"Algorithms for Synthesis and Verification of Timed Circuits and Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ran Ginosar","Rakefet Kol","Kenneth Stevens","Peter Beerel","Kenneth Yun","Chris Myers","Shai Rotem"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":936144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601236481,"objectID":"36c8e0456b52b147c2e5eb2e01658b9c","permalink":"/publication/apparatus-method-selftimed-ginosar-1999/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T17:11:35.052654Z","relpermalink":"/publication/apparatus-method-selftimed-ginosar-1999/","section":"publication","summary":"A self-timed instruction marking circuit includes a prefix handling system for processing instruction bytes having prefix bytes.

A place delay is the expected value of its associated distribution and its weight denotes its importance in the average path of the TSPN. The approach analyzes finite execution traces of the TSPN to derive an expression for the weight values in the SCP. The weights can be analyzed with basic statistics to within an arbitrary error bound. This paper demonstrates the use of the SCP to aggressively optimize timed asynchronous circuits for improved average-case performance by reducing transistor counts, reordering input pins at gates, and skewing transistor sizes to favor important transitions.

Current synchronous methods of architectural-level synthesis do not exploit properties inherent to asynchronous circuits. This research describes potential optimizations and techniques that can be applied to the architectural-level design of asynchronous systems. The proposed methods take advantage of asynchronous circuit properties such as data-dependent delays, modularity, and composiblity. The optimization problems of scheduling and allocation are studied. For scheduling, some counterintuitive properties of delays in a system are shown. The design space is studied and several filters to reduce the size of the design space are proposed. To evaluate and test these ideas the CAD tool Mercury was developed and is described in detail. Mercury is unique in that it can take an abstract model of a design, in this case a data ow graph, and from that generate both an optimal structural view of an asynchronous datapath for the design, as well as the necessary behavioral control to operate that datapath. Several case studies are presented utilizing the tool and methods to illustrate the practical aspects of this work.","tags":["\"Search\""],"title":"Architectural-Level Synthesis of Asynchronous Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert A.
