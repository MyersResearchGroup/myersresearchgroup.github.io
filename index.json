These glitches can have drastic effects if the output of the circuit causes irreversible changes within or with other cells such as a cascade of responses, apoptosis, or the release of a pharmaceutical in an off-target tissue. Therefore, avoiding unwanted variation of a circuit's output can be crucial for the safe operation of a genetic circuit. This paper investigates what causes unwanted switching variations in combinational genetic circuits using hazard analysis and a new dynamic model generator. The analysis is done in previously built and modeled genetic circuits with known glitching behavior. The dynamic models generated not only predict the same steady-states as previous models but can also predict the unwanted switching variations that have been observed experimentally. Multiple input changes may cause glitches due to propagation delays within the circuit. Modifying the circuit's layout to alter these delays may change the likelihood of certain glitches, but it cannot eliminate the possibility that the glitch may occur. In other words, function hazards cannot be eliminated. Instead, they must be avoided by restricting the allowed input changes to the system. Logic hazards, on the other hand, can be avoided using hazard-free logic synthesis. This paper demonstrates this by showing how a circuit designed using a popular genetic design automation tool can be redesigned to eliminate logic hazards.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic Circuit Dynamics: Hazard and Glitch Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leandro Watanabe","Jacob Barhak","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599481148,"objectID":"e8856d0bf0f169a4f46e9c89836aa4e1","permalink":"/publication/watanabe-toward-2019/","publishdate":"2020-09-07T12:19:07.841291Z","relpermalink":"/publication/watanabe-toward-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Disease modelers have been modeling progression of diseases for several decades using such tools as Markov models or microsimulation. However, they need to address a serious challenge; many models they create are not reproducible. Moreover, there is no proper practice that ensures reproducible models, since modelers rely on loose guidelines that change periodically, rather than well-defined machine-readable standards. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is one such standard that allows exchange of models between different software tools. Recently, the SBML Arrays package has been developed, which extends the standard to allow handling simulation of populations. This paper demonstrates through several abstract examples how microsimulation disease models can be encoded using the SBML Arrays package, enabling reproducible disease modeling.","tags":[],"title":"Toward Reproducible Disease Models Using the Systems Biology Markup Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Göksel Misirli","Tramy Nguyen","James Alastair McLaughlin","Prashant Vaidyanathan","Timothy S.

Computational modeling often requires expert knowledge and data to build models. Clearly, manual creation of models is not scalable for large designs. Despite several automated model construction approaches, computational methodologies to bridge knowledge in design repositories and the process of creating computational models have still not been established. This paper describes a workflow for automatic generation of computational models of genetic circuits from data stored in design repositories using existing standards. This workflow leverages the software tool SBOLDesigner to build structural models that are then enriched by the Virtual Parts Repository API using Systems Biology Open Language (SBOL) data fetched from the SynBioHub design repository. The iBioSim software tool is then utilized to convert this SBOL description into a computational model encoded using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Finally, this SBML model can be simulated using a variety of methods. This workflow provides synthetic biologists with easy to use tools to create predictable biological systems, hiding away the complexity of building computational models. This approach can further be incorporated into other computational workflows for design automation.","tags":[],"title":"A Computational Workflow for the Automated Generation of Models of Genetic Designs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leandro Watanabe","Tramy Nguyen","Michael Zhang","Zach Zundel","Zhen Zhang","Curtis Madsen","Nicholas Roehner","Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599481147,"objectID":"5906d82499921bd90b771a7caf240a6a","permalink":"/publication/watanabe-ibiosim-2019/","publishdate":"2020-09-07T12:19:07.461316Z","relpermalink":"/publication/watanabe-ibiosim-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The iBioSim tool has been developed to facilitate the design of genetic circuits via a model-based design strategy.

Although SBML has been successful in representing a wide variety of biochemical models, the core standard lacks the structure for representing large complex regular systems in a standard way, such as whole-cell and cellular population models. These models require a large number of variables to represent certain aspects of these types of models, such as the chromosome in the whole-cell model and the many identical cell models in a cellular population. While SBML core is not designed to handle these types of models efficiently, the proposed SBML arrays package can represent such regular structures more easily. However, in order to take full advantage of the package, analysis needs to be aware of the arrays structure. When expanding the array constructs within a model, some of the advantages of using arrays are lost. This paper describes a more efficient way to simulate arrayed models. To illustrate the proposed method, this paper uses a population of repressilator and genetic toggle switch circuits as examples.
