Supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF CNS award 0930225), Professor Myers in collaboration with Professor Hao Zheng of the University of South Florida extended verification methods developed for asynchronous and analog circuits to support the verification of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This project developed a number of techniques for improving verification efficiency of such systems. As part of an internship with Wendelin Serwe at Inria, a student on this project, Zhen Zhang, verified a fault-tolerant NoC routing algorithm using the CADP tools. This routing algorithm was developed in collaboration with Professor Tomohiro Yoneda from the National Institute of Informatics.
