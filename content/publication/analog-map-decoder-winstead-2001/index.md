abstract: An all-MOS analog implementation of a MAP decoder is presented for the (8,
  4) extended Hamming code. This paper describes the design and analysis of a tail-biting
  trellis decoder implementation using subthreshold CMOS devices. A VLSI test chip
  has recently returned from fabrication, and preliminary test results indicate accurate
  decoding up to 20 MBit/s.
