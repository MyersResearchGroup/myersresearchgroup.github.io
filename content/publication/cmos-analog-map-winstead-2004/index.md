abstract: Design and test results for a fully integrated translinear tail-biting MAP
  error-control decoder are presented. Decoder designs have been reported for various
  applications which make use of analog computation, mostly for Viterbi-style decoders.
  MAP decoders are more complex, and are necessary components of powerful iterative
  decoding systems such as turbo codes. Analog circuits may require less area and
  power than digital implementations in high-speed iterative applications. Our (8,
  4) Hamming decoder, implemented in an AMI 0.5-/spl mu/m process, is the first functioning
  CMOS analog MAP decoder. While designed to operate in subthreshold, the decoder
  also functions above threshold with a small performance penalty. The chip has been
  tested at bit rates up to 2 Mb/s, and simulations indicate a top speed of about
  10 Mb/s in strong inversion. The decoder circuit size is 0.82 mm/sup 2/, and typical
  power consumption is 1 mW at 1 Mb/s.
