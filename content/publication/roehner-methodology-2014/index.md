abstract: Recently, we have begun to witness the potential of synthetic biology, noted
  here in the form of bacteria and yeast that have been genetically engineered to
  produce biofuels, manufacture drug precursors, and even invade tumor cells. The
  success of these projects, however, has often failed in translation and application
  to new projects, a problem exacerbated by a lack of engineering standards that combine
  descriptions of the structure and function of DNA. To address this need, this paper
  describes a methodology to connect the systems biology markup language (SBML) to
  the synthetic biology open language (SBOL), existing standards that describe biochemical
  models and DNA components, respectively. Our methodology involves first annotating
  SBML model elements such as species and reactions with SBOL DNA components. A graph
  is then constructed from the model, with vertices corresponding to elements within
  the model and edges corresponding to the cause-and-effect relationships between
  these elements. Lastly, the graph is traversed to assemble the annotating DNA components
  into a composite DNA component, which is used to annotate the model itself and can
  be referenced by other composite models and DNA components. In this way, our methodology
  can be used to build up a hierarchical library of models annotated with DNA components.
  Such a library is a useful input to any future genetic technology mapping algorithm
  that would automate the process of composing DNA components to satisfy a behavioral
  specification. Our methodology for SBML-to-SBOL annotation is implemented in the
  latest version of our genetic design automation (GDA) software tool, iBioSim.
