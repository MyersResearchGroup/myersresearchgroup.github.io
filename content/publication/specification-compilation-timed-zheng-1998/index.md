abstract: This thesis presents a framework for the specification and compilation of
  modules in a system that uses different synchronization paradigms. These timed systems
  are described by using timed handshaking expansions (HSE) and a standard hardware
  description language, namely VHDL. Synthesizable subsets of these languages are
  defined to include constructs for describing timing behaviors, as well as, sequencing,
  concurrency, choice and looping. A new formal semantic model, timed event/level
  structures, is used to define the behaviors specified by the synthesizable subsets.
  A compiler is developed to translate the HSE and VHDL specifications to timed event/level
  structures. This compiler is integrated into ATACS, a synthesis tool for timed circuits.
  Finally we demonstrate our methodology on a practical example, an asynchronous implementation
  of the Maxlist algorithm.
