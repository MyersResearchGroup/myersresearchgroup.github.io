abstract: ' Standards support synthetic biology research by enabling the exchange
  of component information. However, using formal representations, such as the Synthetic
  Biology Open Language (SBOL), typically requires either a thorough understanding
  of these standards or a suite of tools developed in concurrence with the ontologies.
  Since these tools may be a barrier for use by many practitioners, the Excel–SBOL
  Converter was developed to facilitate the use of SBOL and integration into existing
  workflows. The converter consists of two Python libraries: one that converts Excel
  templates to SBOL and another that converts SBOL to an Excel workbook. Both libraries
  can be used either directly or via a SynBioHub plugin. '
