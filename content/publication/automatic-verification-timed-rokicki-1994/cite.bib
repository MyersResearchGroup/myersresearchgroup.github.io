 abstract = {This paper presents a new formalism and a new algorithm for verifying timed circuits. The formalism, called orbital nets, allows hierarchical verification based on a behavioral semantics of timed trace theory. We present improvements to a geometric timing algorithm that take advantage of concurrency by using partial orders to reduce the time and space requirements of verification. This algorithm has been fully automated and incorporated into a design system for timed circuits, and experimental results demonstrate that this verification algorithm is practical for realistic examples.},
