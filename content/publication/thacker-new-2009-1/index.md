abstract: Cyber-physical systems, in which computers control real-world mechanisms,
  are ever more pervasive in our society. These complex systems, containing a mixture
  of software, digital hardware, and analog circuitry, are often employed in circumstances
  where their correct behavior is crucial to the safety of their operators. Therefore,
  verifi cation of such systems would be of great value. This dissertation introduces
  a modeling and   veri fication methodology sufficiently powerful to manage the complications
  inherent in this mixeddiscipline design space.
