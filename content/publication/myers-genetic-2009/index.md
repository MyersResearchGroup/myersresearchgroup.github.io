abstract: Electronic design automation (EDA) tools have facilitated the design of
  ever more complex integrated circuits each year. Synthetic biology would also benefit
  from the development of genetic design automation (GDA) tools. Existing GDA tools
  require biologists to design genetic circuits at the molecular level, roughly equivalent
  to designing electronic circuits at the layout level. Analysis of these circuits
  is also performed at this very low level. This paper presents the background and
  issues involved in the development of such a GDA tool for modeling, analysis, and
  design.
