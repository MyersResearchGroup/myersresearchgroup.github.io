abstract: This paper presents a new approach to two-level hazard-free logic minimization
  in the context of extended burst-mode finite-state machine synthesis. The approach
  achieves fast single-output logic minimization that yields solutions that are exact
  in the number of literals. This paper presents algorithms and hazard constraints
  targeting both generalized C-element and two-level standard gate implementations.
  The logic minimization approach presented in this paper is based on state graph
  exploration in conjunction with single-cube cover algorithms. The algorithm achieves
  fast logic minimization by using compacted state graphs, cover tables, and a divide-and-merge
  algorithm for efficient single output minimization. The exact two-level hazard-free
  logic minimizer presented in this paper finds a minimal number of literal solutions
  and is several orders of magnitude faster than existing literal exact methods for
  the largest benchmarks available to date. This includes a benchmark that has never
  been possible to solve exactly in number of literals before.
