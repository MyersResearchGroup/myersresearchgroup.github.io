abstract: $<$section class=\"abstract\"$><$h2 class=\"abstractTitle text-title my-1\"
  id=\"d203e2\"$>$Abstract$<$/h2$><$p$>$People who are engineering biological organisms
  often find it useful to communicate in diagrams, both about the structure of the
  nucleic acid sequences that they are engineering and about the functional relationships
  between sequence features and other molecular species. Some typical practices and
  conventions have begun to emerge for such diagrams. The Synthetic Biology Open Language
  Visual (SBOL Visual) has been developed as a standard for organizing and systematizing
  such conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure
  and function of genetic designs. This document details version 2.0 of SBOL Visual,
  which builds on the prior SBOL Visual 1.0 standard by expanding diagram syntax to
  include functional interactions and molecular species, making the relationship between
  diagrams and the SBOL data model explicit, supporting families of symbol variants,
  clarifying a number of requirements and best practices, and significantly expanding
  the collection of diagram glyphs.$<$/p$><$/section$>$
