abstract: Synthetic biology is a new field in which engineers, biologists, and chemists
  are working together to transform genetic engineering into an advanced engineering
  discipline, one in which the design and construction of novel genetic circuits are
  made possible through the application of engineering principles. This dissertation
  explores two engineering strategies to address the challenges of working with genetic
  technology, namely the development of standards for describing genetic components
  and circuits at separate yet connected levels of detail and the use of Genetic Design
  Automation (GDA) software tools to simplify and speed up the process of optimally
  designing genetic circuits. Its contributions to the field of synthetic biology
  include (1) a proposal for the next version of the Synthetic Biology Open Language
  (SBOL), an existing standard for specifying and exchanging genetic designs electronically,
  and (2) a GDA work ow that enables users of the software tool iBioSim to create
  an abstract functional specication, automatically select genetic components that
  satisfy the specication from a design library, and compose the selected components
  into a standardized genetic circuit design for subsequent analysis and physical
  construction. Ultimately, this dissertation demonstrates how existing techniques
  and concepts from electrical and computer engineering can be adapted to overcome
  the challenges of genetic design and is an example of what is possible when working
  with publicly available standards for genetic design.
