abstract: This paper presents a report on outcomes of the 10th Computational Modeling
  in Biology Network (COMBINE) meeting that was held in Heidelberg, Germany, in July
  of 2019. The annual event brings together researchers, biocurators and software
  engineers to present recent results and discuss future work in the area of standards
  for systems and synthetic biology. The COMBINE initiative coordinates the development
  of various community standards and formats for computational models in the life
  sciences. Over the past 10 years, COMBINE has brought together standard communities
  that have further developed and harmonized their standards for better interoperability
  of models and data. COMBINE 2019 was co-located with a stakeholder workshop of the
  European EU-STANDS4PM initiative that aims at harmonized data and model standardization
  for  in silico  models in the field of personalized medicine, as well as with the
  FAIRDOM PALs meeting to discuss findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable
  (FAIR) data sharing. This report briefly describes the work discussed in invited
  and contributed talks as well as during breakout sessions. It also highlights recent
  advancements in data, model, and annotation standardization efforts. Finally, this
  report concludes with some challenges and opportunities that this community will
  face during the next 10 years.
