abstract: 'Standards are important to synthetic biology because they enable exchange
  and reproducibility of genetic designs. This paper describes a procedure for converting
  between two standards: the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and the Synthetic
  Biology Open Language (SBOL). SBML is a standard for behavioral models of biological
  systems at the molecular level. SBOL describes structural and basic qualitative
  behavioral aspects of a biological design. Converting SBML to SBOL enables a consistent
  connection between behavioral and structural information for a biological design.
  The conversion process described in this paper leverages Systems Biology Ontology
  (SBO) annotations to enable inference of a designs qualitative function.'
