abstract: Data standards are integral for interoperability between software applications,
  since they provide guidelines for how data can be meaningfully exchanged and in
  a uniform manner. While standards provide a bridge for applications to share and
  translate data, they do not guarantee that applications are compatible to perform
  a data exchange or that any translated data is legal and valid. As such, data passed
  from pairing applications must be validated to ensure that the data was not transformed
  or lost in the process of exchanging information. Ideally we would want an exchange
  between tools that is automatically successful; however, the data translated might
  not be legal or valid any longer. Therefore, data exchanges between applications
  need to be evaluated under conditions to ensure that compliance with the standard
  is met. The proposed research is to develop a compliance methodology that tests
  compliance of applications against the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard.
  This research aims to provide a robust test suite, a TestRunner tool implementing
  the compliance strategy, and a demonstration of the created methodology.
