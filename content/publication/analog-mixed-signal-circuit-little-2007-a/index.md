abstract: Formal and semi-formal verification of analog/mixed-signal circuits is complicated
  by the difficulty of obtaining circuit models suitable for analysis. We propose
  a method to generate a formal model from simulation traces. The resulting model
  is conservative in that it includes all of the original simulation traces used to
  generate it plus additional behavior. Information obtained during the model generation
  process can also be used to refine the simulation and verification process.
