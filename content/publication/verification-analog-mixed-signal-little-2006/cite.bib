 abstract = {System on a chip design results in the integration of digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits on the same substrate which further complicates the already difficult validation problem. This paper presents a new model, labeled hybrid Petri nets (LHPNs), that is developed to be capable of modeling such a heterogeneous set of components. This paper also describes a compiler from VHDL-AMS to LHPNs. To support formal verification, this paper presents an efficient zone-based state space exploration algorithm for LHPNs. This algorithm uses a process known as warping to allow zones to describe continuous variables that may be changing at variable rates. Finally, this paper describes the application of this algorithm to a couple of analog/mixed-signal circuit examples},
