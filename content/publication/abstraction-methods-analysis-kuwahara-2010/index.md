abstract: With advances in high throughput methods of data collection for gene regulatory
  networks, we are now in a position to face the challenge of elucidating how these
  genes coupled with environmental stimuli orchestrate the regulation of cell-level
  behaviors. Understanding the behavior of such complex sy...
