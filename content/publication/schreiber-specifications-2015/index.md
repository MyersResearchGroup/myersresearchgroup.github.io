abstract: Standards shape our everyday life. From nuts and bolts to electronic devices
  and technological processes, standardised products and processes are all around
  us. Standards have technological and economic benefits, such as making information
  exchange, production, and services more efficient. However, novel, innovative areas
  often either lack proper standards, or documents about standards in these areas
  are not available from a centralised platform or formal body (such as the International
  Standardisation Organisation).textless/ptextgreatertextlessptextgreaterSystems and
  synthetic biology is a relatively novel area, and it is only in the last decade
  that the standardisation of data, information, and models related to systems and
  synthetic biology has become a community-wide effort. Several open standards have
  been established and are under continuous development as a community initiative.
  COMBINE, the ‘COmputational Modeling in BIology’ NEtwork [1] has been established
  as an umbrella initiative to coordinate and promote the development of the various
  community standards and formats for computational models. There are yearly two meeting,
  HARMONY (Hackathons on Resources for Modeling in Biology), Hackathon-type meetings
  with a focus on development of the support for standards, and COMBINE forums, workshop-style
  events with oral presentations, discussion, poster, and breakout sessions for further
  developing the standards. For more information see http://co.mbine.org/. So far
  the different standards were published and made accessible through the standards’
  web-pages or preprint services. The aim of this special issue is to provide a single,
  easily accessible and citable platform for the publication of standards in systems
  and synthetic biology. This special issue is intended to serve as a central access
  point to standards and related initiatives in systems and synthetic biology, it
  will be published annually to provide an opportunity for standard development groups
  to communicate updated specifications.
