abstract: This paper presents a new approach for verification of asynchronous circuits
  by using automatic abstraction. It attacks the state explosion problem by avoiding
  the generation of a flat state space for the whole design. Instead, it breaks the
  design into blocks and conducts verification on each of them. Using this approach,
  the speed of verification improves dramatically.
