 abstract = {Crucial to the success of synthetic biology is the development of platforms for genetic design automation (GDA). This chapter presents the current state-of-the-art in GDA tools. This chapter also briefly describes the standards used for data representation that enable these GDA tools to work together to complete a genetic design task and the emerging repositories that are available to archive and share these data. Finally, this chapter compares tool capabilities and discusses future requirements for a complete GDA workflow.},
