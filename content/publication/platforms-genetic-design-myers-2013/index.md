abstract: Crucial to the success of synthetic biology is the development of platforms
  for genetic design automation (GDA). This chapter presents the current state-of-the-art
  in GDA tools. This chapter also briefly describes the standards used for data representation
  that enable these GDA tools to work together to complete a genetic design task and
  the emerging repositories that are available to archive and share these data. Finally,
  this chapter compares tool capabilities and discusses future requirements for a
  complete GDA workflow.
