abstract: This paper presents theory and algorithms for the synthesis of standard
  C-implementations of speed-independent circuits. These implementations are block-level
  circuits which may consist of atomic gates to perform complex functions in order
  to ensure hazard freedom. First, we present Boolean covering conditions that guarantee
  that the standard C-implementations operate correctly. Then, we present two algorithms
  that produce optimal solutions to the covering problem. The first algorithm is always
  applicable, but does not complete on large circuits. The second algorithm, motivated
  by our observation that our covering problem can often be solved with a single cube,
  finds the optimal single-cube solution when such a solution exists. When applicable,
  the second algorithm is dramatically more efficient than the first, more general
  algorithm. We present results for benchmark specifications which indicate that our
  single-cube algorithm is applicable on most benchmark circuits and reduces run times
  by over an order of magnitude. The block-level circuits generated by our algorithms
  are a good starting point for tools that perform technology mapping to obtain gate-level
  speed-independent circuits.
