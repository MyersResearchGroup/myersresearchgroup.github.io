abstract: "This book presents outstanding contributions in an exciting, new and multidisciplinary\
  \ research area: the application of formal, automated reasoning techniques to analyse\
  \ complex models in systems biology and systems medicine. Automated reasoning is\
  \ a field of computer science devoted to the development of algorithms that yield\
  \ trustworthy answers, providing a basis of sound logical reasoning. For example,\
  \ in the semiconductor industry formal verification is instrumental to ensuring\
  \ that chip designs are free of defects (or ``bugs''). Over the past 15 years, systems\
  \ biology and systems medicine have been introduced in an attempt to understand\
  \ the enormous complexity of life from a computational point of view. This has generated\
  \ a wealth of new knowledge in the form of computational models, whose staggering\
  \ complexity makes manual analysis methods infeasible. Sound, trusted, and automated\
  \ means of analysing the models are thus required in order to be able to trust their\
  \ conclusions. Above all, this is crucial to engineering safe biomedical devices\
  \ and to reducing our reliance on wet-lab experiments and clinical trials, which\
  \ will in turn produce lower economic and societal costs. Some examples of the questions\
  \ addressed here include: Can we automatically adjust medications for patients with\
  \ multiple chronic conditions? Can we verify that an artificial pancreas system\
  \ delivers insulin in a way that ensures Type 1 diabetic patients never suffer from\
  \ hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia? And lastly, can we predict what kind of mutations\
  \ a cancer cell is likely to undergo? This book brings together leading researchers\
  \ from a number of highly interdisciplinary areas, including: $·$ Parameter inference\
  \ from time series $·$ Model selection $·$ Network structure identification $·$\
  \ Machine learning $·$ Systems medicine $·$ Hypothesis generation from experimental\
  \ data $·$ Systems biology, systems medicine, and digital pathology $·$ Verification\
  \ of biomedical devices ``This book presents a comprehensive spectrum of model-focused\
  \ analysis techniques for biological systems ...an essential resource for tracking\
  \ the developments of a fast moving field that promises to revolutionize biology\
  \ and medicine by the automated analysis of models and data.''Prof Luca Cardelli\
