abstract: 'This paper presents a new validation and conversion utility for the Synthetic
  Biology Open Language (SBOL). This utility can be accessed directly in software
  using the libSBOLj library, through a web interface, or using a web service via
  RESTful API calls. The validator checks all required and best practice rules set
  forth in the SBOL specification document, and it reports back to the user the location
  within the document of any errors found. The converter is capable of translating
  from/to SBOL 1, GenBank, and FASTA formats to/from SBOL 2. The SBOL Validator/Converter
  utility is released freely and open source under the Apache 2.0 license. The online
  version of the validator/converter utility can be found here: http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/sbol-validator/.
  The source code for the validator/converter can be found here: http://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-Validator/.'
