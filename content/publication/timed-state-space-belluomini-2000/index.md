abstract: This paper presents a new timing analysis algorithm for efficient state
  space exploration during the synthesis of timed circuits or the verification of
  timed systems. The source of the computational complexity in the synthesis or verification
  of a timed system is in finding the reachable timed state space. We introduce a
  new algorithm which utilizes geometric regions to represent the timed state space
  and partially ordered sets (POSET's) to minimize the number of regions necessary.
  This algorithm operates on specifications sufficiently general to describe practical
  circuits, as well as other timed systems. The algorithm is applied to several examples
  showing significant improvement in runtime and memory usage.
