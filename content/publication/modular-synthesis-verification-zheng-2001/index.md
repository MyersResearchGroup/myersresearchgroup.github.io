abstract: In order to increase performance, circuit designers are beginning to use
  more aggressive timed circuit designs instead of traditional synchronous static
  logic designs. Recent design examples have shown that signi cant performance gains
  are achieved when these aggressive circuit styles are used. Correct operation of
  these aggressive circuit styles is critically dependent on timing, and in industry
  they are typically designed by hand. To synthesize and verify timed circuits, the
  reachable state space of the circuit under the timing constraints needs to be explored.
  However, complete state space exploration is an exponential problem. State space
  explosion limits timed circuit designs to small sizes.
