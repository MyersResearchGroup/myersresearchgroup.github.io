abstract: This paper presents a behavioral synthesis method for asynchronous circuits
  with bundled-data implementation. This paper extends a behavioral synthesis method
  for synchronous circuits so that an RTL model of bundled-data implementation is
  synthesized from a behavioral description specified by a restricted C language.
  Finally, this paper evaluates our method for several benchmarks through a tool implementation.
