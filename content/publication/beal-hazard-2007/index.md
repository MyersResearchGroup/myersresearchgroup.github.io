abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for the hazard checking of timed asynchronous
  circuits. Previous papers proposed either exact algorithms, which suffer from statespace
  explosion, or efficient algorithms which use a (conservative) approximation to avoid
  state-space explosion but can result in the rejection of designs which are valid.
  In particular, [7] presents a timed extention of the work in [1] which is very efficient
  but is not able to handle circuits with internal loops, which prevents its use in
  some cases. We propose a new approach to the problem in order to overcome the mentioned
  limitations, without sacrificing efficiency. To do so, we first introduce a general
  framework targeted at the conservative checking of safety failures. This framework
  is not restricted to the checking of timed asynchronous circuits. Secondly, we propose
  a new (conservative) semantics for timed circuits, in order to use the proposed
  framework for hazard checking of such circuits. Using this framework with the proposed
  semantics yields an efficient algorithm that addresses the limitations of the previous
  approaches.
