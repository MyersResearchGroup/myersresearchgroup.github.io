abstract: The increasing integration of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits into system
  designs has further complicated an already difficult verification problem. Recently,
  formal verification, which has been successful in the purely digital domain, has
  made some in-roads in the AMS domain. This paper describes one such formal verification
  tool for AMS circuits, LEMA. In particular, LEMA is capable of generating a formal
  model from simulation traces that, when coupled with a formal property provided
  in our new property language, can be model checked with one of three model checkers
  within LEMA. This paper briefly describes the capabilities of the LEMA AMS verification
  tool flow.
