abstract: 'We describe an experimental campaign that replicated the performance assessment
  of logic gates engineered into cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Gander et al.
  Our experimental campaign used a novel high-throughput experimentation framework
  developed under Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Synergistic Discovery
  and Design program: a remote robotic lab at Strateos executed a parameterized experimental
  protocol. Using this protocol and robotic execution, we generated two orders of
  magnitude more flow cytometry data than the original experiments. We discuss our
  results, which largely, but not completely, agree with the original report and make
  some remarks about lessons learned.Graphical Abstract'
