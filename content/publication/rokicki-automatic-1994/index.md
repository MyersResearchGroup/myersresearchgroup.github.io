abstract: This paper presents a new formalism and a new algorithm for verifying timed
  circuits. The formalism, called orbital nets, allows hierarchical verification based
  on a behavioral semantics of timed trace theory. We present improvements to a geometric
  timing algorithm that take advantage of concurrency by using partial orders to reduce
  the time and space requirements of verification. This algorithm has been fully automated
  and incorporated into a design system for timed circuits, and experimental results
  demonstrate that this verification algorithm is practical for realistic examples.
