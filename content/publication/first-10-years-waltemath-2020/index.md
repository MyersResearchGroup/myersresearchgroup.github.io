abstract: Abstract                              This paper presents a report on outcomes
  of the 10th Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE) meeting that was
  held in Heidelberg, Germany, in July of 2019. The annual event brings together researchers,
  biocurators and software engineers to present recent results and discuss future
  work in the area of standards for systems and synthetic biology. The COMBINE initiative
  coordinates the development of various community standards and formats for computational
  models in the life sciences. Over the past 10 years, COMBINE has brought together
  standard communities that have further developed and harmonized their standards
  for better interoperability of models and data. COMBINE 2019 was co-located with
  a stakeholder workshop of the European EU-STANDS4PM initiative that aims at harmonized
  data and model standardization for                in silico                models
  in the field of personalized medicine, as well as with the FAIRDOM PALs meeting
  to discuss findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data sharing.
  This report briefly describes the work discussed in invited and contributed talks
  as well as during breakout sessions. It also highlights recent advancements in data,
  model, and annotation standardization efforts. Finally, this report concludes with
  some challenges and opportunities that this community will face during the next
  10 years.
