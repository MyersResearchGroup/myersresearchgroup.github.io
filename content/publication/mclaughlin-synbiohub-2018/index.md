abstract: The SynBioHub repository (https://synbiohub.org) is an open-source software
  project that facilitates the sharing of information about engineered biological
  systems. SynBioHub provides computational access for software and data integration,
  and a graphical user interface that enables users to search for and share designs
  in a Web browser. By connecting to relevant repositories (e.g., the iGEM repository,
  JBEI ICE, and other instances of SynBioHub), the software allows users to browse,
  upload, and download data in various standard formats, regardless of their location
  or representation. SynBioHub also provides a central reference point for other resources
  to link to, delivering design information in a standardized format using the Synthetic
  Biology Open Language (SBOL). The adoption and use of SynBioHub, a community-driven
  effort, has the potential to overcome the reproducibility challenge across laboratories
  by helping to address the current lack of information about published designs.
