abstract: Synthetic biology builds upon the techniques and successes of genetics,
  molecular biology, and metabolic engineering by applying engineering principles
  to the design of biological systems. The field still faces substantial challenges,
  including long development times, high rates of failure, and poor reproducibility.
  One method to ameliorate these problems would be to improve the exchange of information
  about designed systems between laboratories. The Synthetic Biology Open Language
  (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange
  of biological design information in synthetic biology, filling a need not satisfied
  by other pre-existing standards. This document details version 2.0 of SBOL, introducing
  a standardized format for the electronic exchange of information on the structural
  and functional aspects of biological designs. The standard has been designed to
  support the explicit and unambiguous description of biological designs by means
  of a well defined data model. The standard also includes rules and best practices
  on how to use this data model and populate it with relevant design details. The
  publication of this specification is intended to make these capabilities more widely
  accessible to potential developers and users in the synthetic biology community
  and beyond.
