abstract: This paper presents new timing analysis algorithms for efficient state space
  exploration during timed circuit synthesis. Timed circuits are a class of asynchronous
  circuits that incorporate explicit timing information in the specification which
  is used throughout the synthesis procedure to optimize the design. Much of the computational
  complexity in the synthesis of timed circuits currently is in finding the reachable
  timed state space. We introduce new algorithms which utilize geometric regions to
  represent the timed state space and partial orders to minimize the number of regions
  necessary. These algorithms operate on specifications sufficiently general to describe
  practical circuits.
