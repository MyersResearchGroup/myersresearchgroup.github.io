abstract: The Synthetic Biology Knowledge System (SBKS) is an instance of the SynBioHub
  repository that includes text and data information that has been mined from papers
  published in ACS Synthetic Biology. This paper describes the SBKS curation framework
  that is being developed to construct the knowledge stored in this repository. The
  text mining pipeline performs automatic annotation of the articles using natural
  language processing techniques to identify salient content such as key terms, relationships
  between terms, and main topics. The data mining pipeline performs automatic annotation
  of the sequences extracted from the supplemental documents with the genetic parts
  used in them. Together these two pipelines link genetic parts to papers describing
  the context in which they are used. Ultimately, SBKS will reduce the time necessary
  for synthetic biologists to find the information necessary to complete their designs.
