abstract: Locality principles are becoming paramount in controlling advancement of
  data through pipelined systems. Achieving fine grained power down and progressive
  pipeline stalls at the local stage level is therefore becoming increasingly, important
  to enable lower dynamic power consumption while keeping introduced switching noise
  under control as well as avoiding global distribution of timing critical stall signals.
  It has long been known that the interlocking properties of as asynchronous pipelined
  systems have a potential to provide such benefits. However it has not been understood
  how such interlocking can be achieved in synchronous pipelines. This paper presents
  a novel technique based on local clock gating and synchronous handshake protocols
  that achieves stage level interlocking characteristics in synchronous pipelines
  similar to that of asynchronous pipelines. The presented technique is directly applicable
  to traditional synchronous pipelines and works equally well for two-phase clocked
  pipelines based on transparent latches, as well as one-phase clocked pipelines based
  on master-slave latches.
