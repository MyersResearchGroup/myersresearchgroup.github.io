abstract: This work focuses on determining if there are differences in predicted circuit
  failure percentages for three different circuit layouts with identical expected
  functions, using stochastic analysis to simulate different noise sources. The results
  shed light on the difference between the intrinsic and extrinsic noise model predictions
  and if the differences in circuit layouts have any effect on glitch propensities.
  This, in turn, emphasizes the need to evaluate further the relative influence of
  intrinsic and extrinsic noise on a genetic circuit's output to help designers predict
  circuit failures more accurately and, therefore, determine better design choices.
  Moreover, the percent failure predictions between different circuit layouts can
  help designers weigh different options of circuit topologies to determine which
  one is best suited for the intended purposes of the design.
