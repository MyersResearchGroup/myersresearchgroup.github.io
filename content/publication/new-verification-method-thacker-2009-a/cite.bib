 abstract = {Verification of embedded systems is complicated by the fact that they are composed of digital hardware, analog sensors and actuators, and low level software. In order to verify the interaction of these heterogeneous components, it would be beneficial to have a single modeling formalism that is capable of representing all of these components. To address this need, this paper describes an extended labeled hybrid Petri net (LHPN) model that includes constructs for Boolean, discrete, and continuous variables as well as constructs to model timing. This paper also presents a method to verify these extended LHPNs. Finally, this paper presents a case study to illustrate the application of this model to the verification of a fault-tolerant temperature sensor.},
