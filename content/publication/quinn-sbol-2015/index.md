abstract: 'Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) Visual is a graphical standard for
  genetic engineering. It consists of symbols representing DNA subsequences, including
  regulatory elements and DNA assembly features. These symbols can be used to draw
  illustrations for communication and instruction, and as image assets for computer-aided
  design. SBOL Visual is a community standard, freely available for personal, academic,
  and commercial use (Creative Commons CC0 license). We provide prototypical symbol
  images that have been used in scientific publications and software tools. We encourage
  users to use and modify them freely, and to join the SBOL Visual community: http://www.sbolstandard.org/visual.'
