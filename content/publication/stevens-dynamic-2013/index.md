abstract: As the complexity of synthetic genetic circuits increases, modeling is becoming
  a necessary first step to inform subsequent experimental efforts. In recent years,
  the design automation community has developed a wealth of computational tools for
  assisting experimentalists in designing and analyzing new genetic circuits at several
  scales. However, existing software primarily caters to either the DNA- or single-cell
  level, with little support for the multicellular level. To address this need, the
  iBioSim software package has been enhanced to provide support for modeling, simulating,
  and visualizing dynamic cellular populations in a two-dimensional space. This capacity
  is fully integrated into the software, capitalizing on iBioSim’s strengths in modeling,
  simulating, and analyzing single-celled systems.
