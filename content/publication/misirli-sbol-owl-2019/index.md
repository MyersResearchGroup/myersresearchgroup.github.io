abstract: Standard representation of data is key for the reproducibility of designs
  in synthetic biology. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has already emerged
  as a data standard to represent information about genetic circuits, and it is based
  on capturing data using graphs. The language provides the syntax using a free text
  document that is accessible to humans only. This paper describes SBOL-OWL, an ontology
  for a machine understandable definition of SBOL. This ontology acts as a semantic
  layer for genetic circuit designs. As a result, computational tools can understand
  the meaning of design entities in addition to parsing structured SBOL data. SBOL-OWL
  not only describes how genetic circuits can be constructed computationally, it also
  facilitates the use of several existing Semantic Web tools for synthetic biology.
  This paper demonstrates some of these features, for example, to validate designs
  and check for inconsistencies. Through the use of SBOL-OWL, queries can be simplified
  and become more intuitive. Moreover, existing reasoners can be used to infer information
  about genetic circuit designs that cannot be directly retrieved using existing querying
  mechanisms. This ontological representation of the SBOL standard provides a new
  perspective to the verification, representation, and querying of information about
  genetic circuits and is important to incorporate complex design information via
  the integration of biological ontologies.
