abstract: A synthesis method that utilizes timing constraints to generate timed asynchronous
  circuits is presented. By unfolding the cyclic graph specification of an asynchronous
  circuit into an infinite acyclic graph, it is possible to use efficient algorithms
  to analyze the given timing constraints. A sufficient condition for the removal
  of redundancy in the specification is derived. Because of this condition, it is
  only necessary to analyze a finite subgraph of the infinite acyclic graph for derivation
  of a correct implementation. A systematic synthesis procedure that further optimizes
  the implementation based on the timing constraints is applied to the reduced specification.
  It is shown that the resulting timed implementation can be significantly reduced
  in complexity from its speed-independent counterpart while remaining hazard-free
  under the given timing constraints.textlesstextgreater
