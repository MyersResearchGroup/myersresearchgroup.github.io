abstract: 'This paper presents results on the design and analysis of a robust genetic
  Muller C-element. The Muller C-element is a standard logic gate commonly used to
  synchronize independent processes in most asynchronous electronic circuits. Synthetic
  biological logic gates have been previously demonstrated, but there remain many
  open issues in the design of sequential (state-holding) logic operations. Three
  designs are considered for the genetic Muller C-element: a majority gate, a toggle
  switch, and a speed-independent implementation. While the three designs are logically
  equivalent, each design requires different assumptions to operate correctly. The
  majority gate design requires the most timing assumptions, the speed-independent
  design requires the least, and the toggle switch design is a compromise between
  the two. This paper examines the robustness of these designs as well as the effects
  of parameter variation using stochastic simulation. The results show that robustness
  to timing assumptions does not necessarily increase reliability, suggesting that
  modifications to existing logic design tools are going to be necessary for synthetic
  biology. Parameter variation simulations yield further insights into the design
  principles necessary for building robust genetic gates. The results suggest that
  high gene count, cooperativity of at least two, tight repression, and balanced decay
  rates are necessary for robust gates. Finally, this paper presents a potential application
  of the genetic Muller C-element as a quorum-mediated trigger.'
