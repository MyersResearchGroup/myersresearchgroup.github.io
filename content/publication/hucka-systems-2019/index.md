abstract: Computational models can help researchers to interpret data, understand
  biological functions, and make quantitative predictions. The Systems Biology Markup
  Language (SBML) is a file format for representing computational models in a declarative
  form that different software systems can exchange. SBML is oriented towards describing
  biological processes of the sort common in research on a number of topics, including
  metabolic pathways, cell signaling pathways, and many others. By supporting SBML
  as an input/output format, different tools can all operate on an identical representation
  of a model, removing opportunities for translation errors and assuring a common
  starting point for analyses and simulations. This document provides the specification
  for Release 2 of Version 2 of SBML Level 3 Core. The specification defines the data
  structures prescribed by SBML as well as their encoding in XML, the eXtensible Markup
  Language. Release 2 corrects some errors and clarifies some ambiguities discovered
  in Release 1. This specification also defines validation rules that determine the
  validity of an SBML document, and provides many examples of models in SBML form.
  Other materials and software are available from the SBML project website at http://sbml.org/
