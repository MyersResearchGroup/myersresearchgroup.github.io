abstract: Models of cyber-physical systems are inherently complex since they must
  represent hardware, software, and the physical environment. Formal verification
  of these models is often precluded by state explosion. Fortunately, many important
  properties may only depend upon a relatively small portion of the system being accurately
  modeled. This paper presents an automatic abstraction methodology that simplifies
  the model accordingly. Preliminary results on a fault-tolerant temperature sensor
  are encouraging.
