abstract: Computational models can help researchers to interpret data, understand
  biological functions, and make quantitative predictions. The Systems Biology Markup
  Language (SBML) is a file format for representing computational models in a declarative
  form that different software systems can exchange. SBML is oriented towards describing
  biological processes of the sort common in research on a number of topics, including
  metabolic pathways, cell signaling pathways, and many others. By supporting SBML
  as an input/output format, different tools can all operate on an identical representation
  of a model, removing opportunities for translation errors and assuring a common
  starting point for analyses and simulations. This document provides the specification
  for Version 2 of SBML Level 3 Core. The specification defines the data structures
  prescribed by SBML, their encoding in XML (the eXtensible Markup Language), validation
  rules that determine the validity of an SBML document, and examples of models in
  SBML form. The design of Version 2 differs from Version 1 principally in allowing
  new MathML constructs, making more child elements optional, and adding identifiers
  to all SBML elements instead of only selected elements. Other materials and software
  are available from the SBML project website at http://sbml.org/.
