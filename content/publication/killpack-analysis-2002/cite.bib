 abstract = {This thesis describes an evaluation of a locally-clocked module. Locally-clocked modules can be used as synchronous datapath elements in synchronous systems or as asynchronous elements in an asynchronous system. One key element of a locally-clocked module is a stoppable ring oscillator (or stoppable clock). If locally-clocked modules are to be used, their practicality must be quantified. Namely, it must be shown that a reliable and useful stoppable clock can be built. This thesis presents the design and evaluation of a fabricated locally-clocked sequential multiplier. The multiplier is used as a driving example to evaluate local clocks. The design for the stoppable clock is a hybrid of stoppable clocks from previous work. The same gates that make up the critical path of the multiplier are used to make the delay element of the stoppable clock. Although the stoppable clock is meant to track the datapath under a wide range of voltages and temperatures, it is shown that the clock requires tuning to match the critical path sometimes. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to match the critical path exactly. In addition, some temperature and voltage data points cause the cutoff path for the clock to be too slow. This problem is fixed by slowing down the clock. Future designs can focus on speeding up the cutoff path; thus, matching the critical path delay is the only limiting factor on clock frequency. A 20-bit multiplier was fabricated through MOSIS using AMI’s 0.5 μm process. The multiplier consumes 0.468 mm2 and contains 8190 transistors. With a 5 volt power supply, the multiplier runs at 13.3 MHz and consumes 196.6 mW of power, while the stoppable clock runs at 174 MHz. This thesis presents latency and power measurements for the multiplier and stoppable clock in addition to a detailed analysis of stoppable clocks. Process variation is analyzed in that five chips are tested and shown to have little variation in measured values.},
