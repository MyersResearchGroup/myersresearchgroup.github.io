abstract: The emergence of digitally-intensive analog circuits introduces new challenges
  to formal verification due to increased digital design content, and non-ideal digital
  effects such as finite resolution, round-off error and overflow. We propose a machine
  learning approach to convert digital blocks to conservative analog approximations
  via the use of kernel ridge regression. These learned models are then adopted in
  a hybrid formal reachability analysis framework where the support function based
  manipulations are developed to efficiently handle the large linear portion of the
  design and the more general satisfiability modulo theories technique is applied
  to the remaining nonlinear portion. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated
  for the locked time verification of a digitally intensive phase locked loop.
