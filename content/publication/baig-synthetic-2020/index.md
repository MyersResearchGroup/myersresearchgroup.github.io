abstract: People who are engineering biological organisms often find it useful to
  communicate in diagrams, both about the structure of the nucleic acid sequences
  that they are engineering and about the functional relationships between sequence
  features and other molecular species. Some typical practices and conventions have
  begun to emerge for such diagrams. The Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL
  Visual) has been developed as a standard for organizing and systematizing such conventions
  in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure and function
  of genetic designs. This document details version 2.2 of SBOL Visual, which builds
  on the prior SBOL Visual 2.1 in several ways. First, the grounding of molecular
  species glyphs is changed from BioPAX to SBO, aligning with the use of SBO terms
  for interaction glyphs. Second, new glyphs are added for proteins, introns, and
  polypeptide regions (e. g., protein domains), the prior recommended macromolecule
  glyph is deprecated in favor of its alternative, and small polygons are introduced
  as alternative glyphs for simple chemicals.
