abstract: This paper proposes a behavioral synthesis system for asynchronous circuits
  with bundled-data implementation. The proposed system is based on a behavioral synthesis
  method for synchronous circuits and extended on operation scheduling and control
  synthesis for bundled-data implementation. The proposed system synthesizes an RTL
  model and a simulation model from a behavioral description specified by a restricted
  C language, a resource library, and a set of design constraints. This paper shows
  the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of area and latency through comparisons
  among bundled-data implementations synthesized by the proposed system, synchronous
  counterparts, and bundled-data implementations synthesized by using a behavioral
  synthesis method for synchronous circuits directly.
