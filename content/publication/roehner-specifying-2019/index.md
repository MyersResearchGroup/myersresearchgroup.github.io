abstract: As improvements in DNA synthesis technology and assembly methods make combinatorial
  assembly of genetic constructs increasingly accessible, methods for representing
  genetic constructs likewise need to improve to handle the exponential growth of
  combinatorial design space. To this end, we present a community accepted extension
  of the SBOL data standard that allows for the efficient and flexible encoding of
  combinatorial designs. This extension includes data structures for representing
  genetic designs with "variable" components that can be implemented by choosing one
  of many linked designs for existing genetic parts or constructs. We demonstrate
  the representational power of the SBOL combinatorial design extension through case
  studies on metabolic pathway design and genetic circuit design, and we report the
  expansion of the SBOLDesigner software tool to support users in creating and modifying
  combinatorial designs in SBOL.
