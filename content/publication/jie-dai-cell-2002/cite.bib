 abstract = {This paper presents a cell library for automatic synthesis of analog error control decoders. By using some basic cells, analog error control decoders can be automatically synthesized. Also, using automatic synthesis based on this cell library, the circuit performance is not degraded and the circuit is smaller and lower power compared with corresponding canonical designs.},
