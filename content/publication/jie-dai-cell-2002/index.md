abstract: This paper presents a cell library for automatic synthesis of analog error
  control decoders. By using some basic cells, analog error control decoders can be
  automatically synthesized. Also, using automatic synthesis based on this cell library,
  the circuit performance is not degraded and the circuit is smaller and lower power
  compared with corresponding canonical designs.
