 abstract = {The iBioSim tool has been developed to facilitate the design of genetic circuits via a model-based design strategy. This paper illustrates the new features incorporated into the tool for DNA circuit design, design analysis, and design synthesis, all of which can be used in a workflow for the systematic construction of new genetic circuits.},
