 abstract = {Adaptive routing is a sensible approach to enhance fault-tolerance in Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, but can cause deadlock if implemented improperly. Glass and Ni proposed an adaptive routing algorithm based on a turn model which is proven to tolerate at least one fault in each routing process and is free of deadlock. However, when faults happen on links of a network instead of on nodes, these two claims are no longer true. This paper proposes an improved routing algorithm based on the Glass/Ni protocol which tolerates a single link fault while still avoiding deadlock in a mesh network. Simulation results indicate that this improved algorithm provides significant improvements in network reliability with minimal cost.},
