 abstract = {We present an efficient asynchronous VLSI architecture for calculating running maximum or minimum values over a sliding window. Running maximums or minimums are very useful for many signal and image processing tasks. Our architecture performs the calculation using the MAXLIST algorithm. In order to take advantage of the wide delay variations due to data-dependencies and operating conditions, an asynchronous approach is taken to achieve higher performance and lower power. Simulation results demonstrate that our asynchronous architecture is significantly faster than existing and potential synchronous architectures.},
