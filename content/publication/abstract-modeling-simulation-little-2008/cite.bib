 abstract = {Abstract. Analog/Mixed-signal (AMS) circuit verification is a growing problem as process variation increases and AMS circuits become more functionally complex. To improve analog verification flows, AMS circuit models are needed at different levels of abstraction. This paper discusses recent work and future directions for abstract model generation and simulation aided verification of AMS circuits. In particular, a CMOS ring oscillator with feedforward inverters is used as a motivating example for the work. This example highlights progress and future directions in AMS modeling and verification. 1},
