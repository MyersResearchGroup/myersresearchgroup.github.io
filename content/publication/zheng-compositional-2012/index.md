abstract: This paper presents a compositional minimization approach with efficient
  state space reductions for verifying non-trivial asynchronous designs. These reductions
  can result in a reduced model that contains the exact same set of observably equivalent
  behavior in the original model, therefore no false counter-examples result from
  the verification of the reduced model. This approach allows designs that cannot
  be handled monolithically or with partial-order reduction to be verified without
  difficulty. The experimental results show significant scale-up of the compositional
  minimization approach using these reductions on a number of large asynchronous designs.
