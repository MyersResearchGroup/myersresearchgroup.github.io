abstract: Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) represent the predominant cause of
  urinary tract infections (UTIs). A key UPEC molecular virulence mechanism is type
  1 fimbriae, whose expression is controlled by the orientation of an invertible chromosomal
  DNA elementâ€” the fim switch. Temperature has been shown to act as a major regulator
  of fim switching behavior and is overall an important indicator as well as functional
  feature of many urologic diseases, including UPEC host-pathogen interaction dynamics.
  Given this panoptic physiological role of temperature during UTI progression and
  notable empirical challenges to its direct in vivo studies, in silico modeling of
  corresponding biochemical and biophysical mechanisms essential to UPEC pathogenicity
  may significantly aid our understanding of the underlying disease processes. However,
  rigorous computational analysis of biological systems, such as fim switch temperature
  control circuit, has hereto presented a notoriously demanding problem due to both
  the substantial complexity of the gene regulatory networks involved as well as their
  often characteristically discrete and stochastic dynamics. To address these issues,
  we have developed an approach that enables automated multiscale abstraction of biological
  system descriptions based on reaction kinetics. Implemented as a computational tool,
  this method has allowed us to efficiently analyze the modular organization and behavior
  of the E. coli fimbriation switch circuit at different temperature settings, thus
  facilitating new insights into this mode of UPEC molecular virulence regulation.
  In particular, our results suggest that, with respect to its role in shutting down
  fimbriae expression, the primary function of FimB recombinase may be to effect a
  controlled down-regulation (rather than increase) of the ON-to-OFF fim switching
  rate via temperature-dependent suppression of competing dynamics mediated by recombinase
  FimE. Our computational analysis further implies that this down-regulation mechanism
  could be particularly significant inside the host environment, thus potentially
  contributing further understanding toward the development of novel therapeutic approaches
  to UPEC-caused UTIs.
