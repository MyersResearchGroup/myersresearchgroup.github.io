abstract: ' Over the past 2 decades, synthetic biology has yielded ever more complex
  genetic circuits that are able to perform sophisticated functions in response to
  specific signals. Yet, genetic circuits are not immediately transferable to an outside-the-lab
  setting where their performance is highly compromised. We propose introducing a
  broader test step to the design–build–test–learn workflow to include factors that
  might contribute to unexpected genetic circuit performance. As a proof of concept,
  we have designed and evaluated a genetic circuit in various temperatures, inducer
  concentrations, nonsterilized soil exposure, and bacterial growth stages. We determined
  that the circuit’s performance is dramatically altered when these factors differ
  from the optimal lab conditions. We observed significant changes in the time for
  signal detection as well as signal intensity when the genetic circuit was tested
  under nonoptimal lab conditions. As a learning effort, we then proceeded to generate
  model predictions in untested conditions, which is currently lacking in synthetic
  biology application design. Furthermore, broader test and learn steps uncovered
  a negative correlation between the time it takes for a gate to turn ON and the bacterial
  growth phases. As the synthetic biology discipline transitions from proof-of-concept
  genetic programs to appropriate and safe application implementations, more emphasis
  on test and learn steps (i.e., characterizing parts and circuits for a broad range
  of conditions) will provide missing insights on genetic circuit behavior outside
  the lab. '
