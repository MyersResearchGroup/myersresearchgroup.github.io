abstract: This book brings together a selection of the best papers from the sixteenth
  edition of the Forum on specification and Design Languages Conference (FDL), which
  was held in September 2013 in Paris, France. FDL is a well-established international
  forum devoted to dissemination of research results, practical experiences and new
  ideas in the application of specification, design and verification languages to
  the design, modeling and verification of integrated circuits, complex hardware/software
  embedded systems and mixed-technology systems.
