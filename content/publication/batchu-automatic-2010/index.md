abstract: Verification of analog circuits is becoming a bottle-neck for the verification
  of complex analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. In order to assist functional verification
  of  complex AMS system-on-chips (SoCs), there is a need to represent the transistor-level
  circuits in the form of abstract models. The ability to represent the analog circuits
  as behavioral models is necessary, but not sufficient. Though there exist languages
  like Verilog-AMS and VHDL-AMS for modeling AMS circuits, there is no easy method
  for generating these models directly from the transistor-level descriptions. This
  thesis presents an improved method for extracting behavioral models from the simulations
  of AMS circuits. This method generates labeled Petri net (LPN) models that can be
  used in the formal verification of circuits, and SystemVerilog models that can be
  used in the system-level simulations.
