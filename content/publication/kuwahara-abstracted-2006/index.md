abstract: 'Abstract — With the aid of model abstractions, biochemical networks can
  be analyzed at different levels of resolution: from low-level quantitative models
  to high-level qualitative ones. Furthermore, an ability to change the level of abstraction
  can be very useful when dealing with many biological systems, including gene regulatory
  networks. These systems typically have too many components and states to be practically
  studied using all-inclusive low-level models, yet they often manifest enough dynamical
  and functional complexity, making an entirely high-level qualitative representation
  similarly inadequate — thus necessitating a search for some intermediate level of
  abstraction. Finally, while most abstractions used in modeling of biochemical networks
  have traditionally been performed manually, doing so accurately in a large system
  is a tedious and time-consuming process that is highly susceptible to errors during
  model transformation. To address these issues, we have developed a methodology and
  implemented an automated modeling and analysis tool with variable abstraction level
  capabilities. In this paper, we use it for the analysis of switching in Type 1 pili
  expression dynamics and, in particular, for the problem of estimating the effect
  of H-NS and Lrp regulatory protein levels on phase variation rates in E. coli. Such
  behavior is notoriously difficult to study due to the size of the associated gene
  regulatory network and the characteristically stochastic dynamics involved, which
  result in very high analytical and computational demands. Here, we show how, by
  using our system, we are able to automatically abstract the switch network and accurately
  predict E. coli afimbriation rates, while, at the same time, accelerating the required
  computations by up to two orders of magnitude. I.'
