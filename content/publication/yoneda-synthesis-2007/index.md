abstract: This paper presents a decomposition-based method for timed circuit design
  that is capable of significantly reducing the cost of synthesis. In particular,
  this method synthesizes each output individually. It begins by contracting the timed
  signal transition graph (STG) to include only transitions on the output of interest
  and its possible trigger signals. Next, the reachable state space for this contracted
  STG is analyzed to determine a minimal number of additional signals, which must
  be reintroduced into the STG to obtain complete state coding. The circuit for this
  output is then synthesized from this STG. Results show that the quality of the circuit
  implementation is nearly as good as the one found from the full reachable state
  space, but it can be applied to find circuits for which full-state-space methods
  cannot be successfully applied. The proposed method has been implemented as a part
  of our tool Nii-Utah Timed Asynchronous circuit Synthesis system (nutas), and its
  first version is available at http://research.nii.ac.jp/ yoneda.
