abstract: The major barrier that prevents the application of formal verification to
  large designs is state explosion. This paper presents a new approach for verification
  of timed circuits using automatic abstraction. This approach partitions the design
  into modules, each with constrained complexity. Before verification is applied to
  each individual module, irrelevant information to the behavior of the selected module
  is abstracted away. This approach converts a verification problem with big exponential
  complexity to a set of subproblems, each with small exponential complexity. Experimental
  results are promising in that they indicate that our approach has the potential
  of completing much faster while using less memory than traditional flat analysis.
