abstract: In order to continue to produce circuits of increasing speeds, designers
  must consider aggressive circuit design styles such as self-resetting or delayed-reset
  domino circuits used in IBM's gigahertz processor (GUTS) and asynchronous circuits
  used in Intel's RAPPID instruction length decoder. These new timed circuit styles,
  however, cannot be efficiently and accurately analyzed using traditional static
  timing analysis methods. This lack of efficient analysis tools is one of the reasons
  for the lack of mainstream acceptance of these design styles. This paper discusses
  several industrial timed circuits and gives an overview of our timed circuit design
  methodology.
