abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for efficiently verifying timed systems.
  The new algorithm represents timing information using geometric regions and explores
  the timed state space by considering partially ordered sets of events rather than
  linear sequences. This approach avoids the explosion of timed states typical of
  highly concurrent systems by dramatically reducing the ratio of timed states to
  untimed states in a system. A general class of timed systems which include both
  event and level causality can be specified and verified. This algorithm is applied
  to several recent timed benchmarks showing orders of magnitude improvement in runtime
  and memory usage.
