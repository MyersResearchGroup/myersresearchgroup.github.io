abstract: Uncertainty presents significant challenges in the reasoning about and controlling
  of complex dynamical systems. To address this challenge, numerous researchers are
  developing improved methods for stochastic analysis. This book presents a diverse
  collection of some of the latest research in this important area. In particular,
  this book gives an overview of some of the theoretical methods and tools for stochastic
  analysis, and it presents the applications of these methods to problems in systems
  theory, science, and economics.
