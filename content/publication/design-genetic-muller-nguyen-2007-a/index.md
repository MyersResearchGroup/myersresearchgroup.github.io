abstract: Synthetic biology uses engineering principles to design circuits out of
  genetic materials that are inserted into bacteria to perform various tasks. While
  synthetic combinational Boolean logic gates have been constructed, there are many
  open issues in the design of sequential logic gates. One such gate common in most
  asynchronous circuits is the Muller C-element, which is used to synchronize multiple
  independent processes. This paper proposes a novel design for a genetic Muller C-element
  using transcriptional regulatory elements. The design of a genetic Muller C-element
  enables the construction of virtually any asynchronous circuit from genetic material.
  There are, however, many issues that complicate designs with genetic materials.
  These complications result in modifications being required to the normal digital
  design procedure. This paper presents two designs that are logically equivalent
  to a Muller C-element. Mathematical analysis and stochastic simulation, however,
  show that only one functions reliably.
