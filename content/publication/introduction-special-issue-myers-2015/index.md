abstract: The goal of this special issue is to introduce the field of computational
  synthetic biology to engineers and computer scientists. The first article gives
  an introduction to the key biological principles and experimental techniques that
  support synthetic biology, and it draws analogies with the computing field. This
  issue also includes five original research articles in computational synthetic biology.
  The first research article discusses how standards can be used to modularize the
  design process for genetic circuits. The next two articles introduce new abstraction
  techniques to improve the efficiency of analysis of genetic circuit models. The
  last two articles introduce new design techniques that help decouple design from
  construction. We hope this sampling from the field will help to motivate others
  to join this exciting and rich area of research.
