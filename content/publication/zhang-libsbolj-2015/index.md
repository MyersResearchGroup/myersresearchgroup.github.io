abstract: The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is an emerging data standard
  for representing synthetic biology designs. The goal of SBOL is to improve the reproducibility
  of these designs and their electronic exchange between researchers and/or genetic
  design automation tools. The latest version of the standard, SBOL 2.0, enables the
  annotation of a large variety of biological components (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins,
  complexes, small molecules, etc.) and their interactions. SBOL 2.0 also allows researchers
  to organize components into hierarchical modules, to specify their intended functions,
  and to link modules to models that describe their behavior mathematically. To support
  the use of SBOL 2.0, we have developed the libSBOLj 2.0 Java library, which provides
  an easy to use Application Programming Interface (API) for developers, including
  manipulation of SBOL constructs, serialization to and from an RDF/XML file format,
  and migration support in the form of conversion from the prior SBOL 1.1 standard
  to SBOL 2.0. This letter describes the libSBOLj 2.0 library and key engineering
  decisions involved in its design.
