abstract: This paper presents a novel workflow for the design of mixed-signal systems
  with asynchronous control. Current methods rely on synchronous control logic and
  full-system simulation, which might lead to suboptimal results and even project
  respins due to critical errors. Asynchronous circuits can provide greater robustness,
  reactivity, and power efficiency. The proposed workflow aims to combine state-of-the-art
  tools for asynchronous circuit design and formal verification of analog systems
  in a unified environment. The effectiveness of this methodology is demonstrated
  by the analysis of a buck converter.
