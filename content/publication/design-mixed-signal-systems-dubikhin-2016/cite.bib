 abstract = {This paper presents a novel workflow for the design of mixed-signal systems with asynchronous control. Current methods rely on synchronous control logic and full-system simulation, which might lead to suboptimal results and even project respins due to critical errors. Asynchronous circuits can provide greater robustness, reactivity, and power efficiency. The proposed workflow aims to combine state-of-the-art tools for asynchronous circuit design and formal verification of analog systems in a unified environment. The effectiveness of this methodology is demonstrated by the analysis of a buck converter.},
