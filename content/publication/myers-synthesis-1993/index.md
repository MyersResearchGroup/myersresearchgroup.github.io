abstract: The authors present a systematic procedure for synthesizing timed asynchronous
  circuits using timing constraints dictated by system integration, thereby facilitating
  natural interaction between synchronous and asynchronous circuits. Their timed circuits
  also tend to be more efficient, in both speed and area, compared with traditional
  asynchronous circuits. The synthesis procedure begins with a cyclic graph specification
  to which timing constraints can be added. First, the cyclic graph is unfolded into
  an infinite acyclic graph. Then, an analysis of two finite subgraphs of the infinite
  acyclic graph detects and removes redundancy in the original specification based
  on the given timing constraints. From this reduced specification, an implementation
  that is guaranteed to function correctly under the timing constraints is systematically
  synthesized. With practical circuit examples, it is demonstrated that the resulting
  timed implementation is significantly reduced in complexity compared with implementations
  previously derived using other methodologies.textlesstextgreater
