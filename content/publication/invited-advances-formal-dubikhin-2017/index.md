abstract: Analog/mixed-signal (AMS) systems are rapidly expanding in all domains of
  information and communication technology. They are a critical part of the support
  for large-scale high-performance digital systems, provide important functionalities
  in medium-scale embedded and mobile systems, and act as a core organ of autonomous
  electronics such as sensor nodes. Analog and digital parts are closely inter-mixed,
  hence demanding AMS design methods and tools to be more holistic. In particular,
  the emergence of ``little digital'' electronics inside or near analog circuitry
  calls for the increasing use of asynchronous logic. To cope with the growing complexity
  of AMS designs, formal methods are required to complement traditional simulation
  approaches. This paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art in AMS formal
  verification and asynchronous design that enables the development of analog/asynchronous
  co-design methods. One such co-design methodology is exemplified by the LEMA-Workcraft
  workflow currently under development by the authors.
