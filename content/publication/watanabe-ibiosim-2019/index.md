abstract: The iBioSim tool has been developed to facilitate the design of genetic
  circuits via a model-based design strategy. This paper illustrates the new features
  incorporated into the tool for DNA circuit design, design analysis, and design synthesis,
  all of which can be used in a workflow for the systematic construction of new genetic
  circuits.
