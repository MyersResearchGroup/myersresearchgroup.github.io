abstract: Stochastic model checking is a technique for analyzing systems that possess
  probabilistic characteristics. However, its scalability is limited as probabilistic
  models of real-world applications typically have very large or infinite state space.
  This paper presents a new infinite state CTMC model checker, STAMINA, with improved
  scalability. It uses a novel state space approximation method to reduce large and
  possibly infinite state CTMC models to finite state representations that are amenable
  to existing stochastic model checkers. It is integrated with a new property-guided
  state expansion approach that improves the analysis accuracy. Demonstration of the
  tool on several benchmark examples shows promising results in terms of analysis
  efficiency and accuracy compared with a state-of-the-art CTMC model checker that
  deploys a similar approximation method.
