abstract: In the context of synthetic biology, model generation is the automated process
  of constructing biochemical models based on genetic designs. This paper discusses
  the use cases for model generation in genetic design automation (GDA) software tools
  and introduces the foundational concepts of standards and model annotation that
  make this process useful. Finally, this paper presents an implementation of model
  generation in the GDA software tool iBioSim and provides an example of generating
  a Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) model from a design of a 4-input AND sensor
  written in the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL).
