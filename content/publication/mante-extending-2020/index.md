abstract: 'SynBioHub is a repository for synthetic genetic designs represented in
  the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL). To integrate SynBioHub into more synthetic
  biology workflows, its data processing capabilities need to be expanded. To this
  end, a plugin interface has been developed. Plugins can be developed for data submission,
  visualization, and download. This framework was tested by the development of three
  example plugins, one of each type as follows: one allowing the submission of SnapGene
  files, one visualizing the course of different genetic parts, and one preparing
  plasmid maps for download.'
