abstract: This paper presents several state space reductions for verifying non-trivial
  asynchronous designs with a compositional minimization approach. These reductions
  result in a reduced model that contains the exact set of observably equivalent behavior.
  Therefore no false counter-examples are produced at the end of verification. The
  experimental results show good scale-up of compositional minimization using these
  reductions on a number of asynchronous designs.
