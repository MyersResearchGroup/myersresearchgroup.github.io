abstract: This paper develops a modular synthesis algorithm for timed circuits that
  is dramatically accelerated by partial order reduction. This algorithm synthesizes
  each module in a hierarchical design individually. It utilizes partial order reduction
  to reduce the state space explored for the other modules by considering a single
  interleaving of concurrently enabled transitions. This approach better manages the
  state explosion problem resulting in a more than 2 order of magnitude reduction
  in synthesis time. The improved synthesis time enables the synthesis of a larger
  class of timed circuits than was previously possible.
