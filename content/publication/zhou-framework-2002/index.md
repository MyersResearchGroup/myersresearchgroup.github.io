abstract: This paper develops a framework to support trace theoretic verification
  of timed circuits and systems. A theoretical foundation for classifying timed traces
  as either successes or failures is developed. The concept of the semimirror is introduced
  to allow conformance checking thus supporting hierarchical verification of timed
  circuits and systems. Finally, we relate our framework to those previously proposed
  for timing verification.
