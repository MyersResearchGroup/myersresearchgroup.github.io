abstract: Using a level-oriented model for verification of asynchronous circuits helps
  users to easily construct formal models with high readability or to naturally model
  datapath circuits. On the other hand, in order to use such a model on large circuits,
  techniques to avoid the state explosion problem must be developed. This paper first
  introduces a level-oriented formal model based on time Petri nets, and then proposes
  its partial order reduction algorithm that prunes unnecessary state generation while
  guaranteeing the correctness of the verification.
