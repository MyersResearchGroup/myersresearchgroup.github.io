abstract: This paper presents pySBOL, a software library for computer-aided design
  of synthetic biological systems in the Python scripting language. This library provides
  an easy-to-use, object-oriented, application programming interface (API) with low
  barrier of entry for synthetic biology application developers. The pySBOL library
  enables reuse of genetic parts and designs through standardized data exchange with
  biological parts repositories and software tools that communicate using the Synthetic
  Biology Open Language (SBOL). In addition, pySBOL supports data management of design-build-test-learn
  workflows for individual laboratories as well as large, distributed teams of synthetic
  biologists. PySBOL also lets users add custom data to SBOL files to support the
  specific data requirements of their research. This extensibility helps users integrate
  software tool chains and develop workflows for new applications. These features
  and others make the pySBOL library a valuable tool for supporting engineering practices
  in synthetic biology. Documentation and installation instructions can be found at
  pysbol2.readthedocs.io.
