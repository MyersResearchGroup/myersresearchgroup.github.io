 abstract = {Circuit designers are increasingly more drawn to challenges in modeling and designing biological circuits and systems. While the principles of biological organization and architecture resemble those in systems that engineers are designing, the complexity of biological systems still seems to be beyond the designed ones. This session discusses state-of-the-art in tackling such challenges, and presents existing methods for automation of model development, design and analysis of biological circuits and systems. The speakers are experts from systems biology, synthetic biology, and design automation fields. The three talks will cover a range of topics that include rule-based modeling approach to model cell signaling networks, automation of genetic circuit design, and the importance and development of standards in synthetic biology.},
