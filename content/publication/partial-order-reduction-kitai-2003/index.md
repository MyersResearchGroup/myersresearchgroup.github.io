abstract: Using a level oriented model for verification of asynchronous circuits helps
  users to easily construct formal models with high readability or to naturally model
  data-path circuits. On the other hand, in order to use such a model for larger circuit,
  some technique to avoid the state explosion problem is essential. This paper first
  defines a level oriented formal model based on time Petri nets, and then proposes
  a partial order reduction algorithm that prunes unnecessary state generation while
  guaranteeing the correctness of the verification.
