abstract: This thesis presents a method of deriving a performance metric for timed
  asynchronous circuits called a stochastic cycle period, which uses analytical techniques
  combined with simulation to capture the stochastic profile of the system. The stochastic
  cycle period is constructed by finding transition and steady-state probabilities
  in a reachability graph of the timed circuit. The transition and steady-state probabilities
  are used to obtain trigger probabilities in the circuit implementation. The trigger
  probabilities are employed in a timing simulation to construct the stochastic cycle
  period of the timed specification. Since this performance metric is a stochastic
  profile of the circuit behavior with regards to its individual components, synthesis
  optimization efforts can be focused on areas that significantly improve the expected
  cost of a cycle in the system. This thesis presents some case studies where the
  metric is used to evaluate and improve designs. The studies show the potentia...
