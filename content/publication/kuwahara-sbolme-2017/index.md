abstract: The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a community-driven open language
  to promote standardization in synthetic biology. To support the use of SBOL in metabolic
  engineering, we developed SBOLme, the first open-access repository of SBOL 2-compliant
  biochemical parts for a wide range of metabolic engineering applications. The URL
  of our repository is http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/sbolme.
