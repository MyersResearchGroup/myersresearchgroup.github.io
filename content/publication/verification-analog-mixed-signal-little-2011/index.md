abstract: Mixed-signal designs integrate digital and analog circuits which complicates
  the already difficult verification problem. This paper presents a model, labeled
  hybrid Petri nets (LHPNs), that is developed to model this heterogeneous set of
  components. To support formal verification, this paper presents an efficient zone-based
  state space exploration algorithm for LHPNs. This algorithm uses a process known
  as warping which allows zones to describe continuous variables changing at variable
  rates. Finally, this paper describes the application of this algorithm to analog/mixed-signal
  circuit examples.
