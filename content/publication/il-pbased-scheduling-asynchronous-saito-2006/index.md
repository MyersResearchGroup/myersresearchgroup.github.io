abstract: In this paper, we propose a new scheduling method for asynchronous circuits
  in bundled-data implementation. The method is based on integer linear programming
  (ILP) which explores an optimum schedule under resource or time constraints. To
  schedule descriptions with many operations, our method approximate start times of
  operations and formulate an ILP based on the approximated start times. Because less
  numbers of variables and constraints are required compared to the traditional ILP
  formulation, the schedule of operations is determined in short time preserving the
  quality of resulting circuit.
