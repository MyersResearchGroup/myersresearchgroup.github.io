abstract: The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a community-developed data
  standard that allows knowledge about biological designs to be captured using a machine-tractable,
  ontology-backed representation that is built using Semantic Web technologies. While
  early versions of SBOL focused only on the description of DNA-based components and
  their sub-components, SBOL can now be used to represent knowledge across multiple
  scales and throughout the entire synthetic biology workflow, from the specification
  of a single molecule or DNA fragment through to multicellular systems containing
  multiple interacting genetic circuits. The third major iteration of the SBOL standard,
  SBOL3, is an effort to streamline and simplify the underlying data model with a
  focus on real-world applications, based on experience from the deployment of SBOL
  in a variety of scientific and industrial settings. Here, we introduce the SBOL3
  specification both in comparison to previous versions of SBOL and through practical
  examples of its use.
