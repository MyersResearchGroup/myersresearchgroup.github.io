abstract: This paper presents a technology mapping technique for optimizing the average-case
  delay of asynchronous combinational circuits implemented using domino logic and
  one-hot encoded outputs. The technique minimizes the critical path for common input
  patterns at the possible expense of making less common critical paths longer. To
  demonstrate the application of this technique, we present a case study of a combinational
  length decoding block, an integral component of an Asynchronous Instruction Length
  Decoder (AILD) which can be used in Pentium(R) processors. The experimental results
  demonstrate that the average-case delay of our mapped circuits can be dramatically
  lower than the worst-case delay of the circuits obtained using conventional worst-case
  mapping techniques.
