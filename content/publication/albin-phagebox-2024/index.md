abstract: Objective Recent advancements demonstrate the significant role of digital microfluidics in automating laboratory work with DNA and on-site viral testing. However, since commercially available instruments are limited to droplet manipulation, our work addresses the need for accelerated integration of other components, such as temperature control, that can expand the application domain. Methods We developed PhageBox—an accessible device that can be used as a biochip extension. At hardware level, PhageBox integrates temperature and electromagnetic control modules. At software level, PhageBox is controlled by embedded software containing a unique model for bio-protocol programming, and a graphical user interface for visual device feedback and operation. Results To evaluate PhageBox's efficacy for biomedical applications, we performed functional testing. Similarly, we validated the temperature control using thermography, obtaining a range of ± 0.2 ∘C . The electromagnets produced a magnetic force of 15 milliTesla, demonstrating precise immobilization of magnetic beads. We show the potential of PhageBox for bacteriophage research through three initial protocols a universal framework for PCR, T7 bacteriophage restriction enzyme digestion, and concentrating ϕX174 RF genomic DNA. Conclusion Our work presents an open-source hardware and software extension for digital microfluidics devices. This extension integrates temperature and electromagnetic modules, demonstrating efficacy in biomedical applications and potential for bacteriophage research. Significance We developed PhageBox to be accessible the components are off-the-shelf at a low cost ( ≤ $ 200), and the hardware designs and software code are open-source. With the long aim of ensuring reproducibility and accelerating collaboration, we also provide a DIY-build document.
