abstract: This paper describes an investigation of potential advantages and pitfalls
  of applying an asynchronous design methodology to an advanced microprocessor architecture.
  A prototype complex instruction set length decoding and steering unit was implemented
  using self-timed circuits. [The Revolving Asynchronous Pentium/sup (R)/ Processor
  Instruction Decoder (RAPPID) design implemented the complete Pentium II/sup (R)/
  32-bit MMX instruction set.] The prototype chip was fabricated on a 0.25 /spl mu/m
  CMOS process and tested successfully. Results show significant advantages - in particular,
  performance of 2.5-4.5 instructions per nanosecond - with manageable risks using
  this design technology. The prototype achieves three times the throughput and half
  the latency, dissipating only half the power and requiring about the same area as
  the fastest commercial 400 MHz clocked circuit fabricated on the same process.
