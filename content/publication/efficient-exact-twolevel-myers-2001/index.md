abstract: This paper presents a new approach to two-level hazard free sum-of-products
  logic minimization. No currently available minimizers for single-output literal-exact
  two-level hazard-free logic minimization can handle large circuits without synthesis
  times ranging up over thousands of seconds. The logic minimization approach presented
  in this paper is based on state graph exploration in conjunction with single-cube
  cover algorithms. Our algorithm achieves fast logic minimization by using compacted
  state graphs and cover tables and an efficient algorithm for single-output minimization.
  Our exact two-level hazard-free logic minimizer finds a minimal number of literal
  solutions and is significantly faster than existing literal exact methods-over two
  orders of magnitude faster for the largest extended burst-mode benchmarks to date.
  This includes a benchmark that has never been possible to solve exactly in a number
  of literals before.
