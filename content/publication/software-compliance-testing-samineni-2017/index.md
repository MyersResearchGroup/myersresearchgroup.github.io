abstract: Data Standards provide a way of expressing data in a uniform manner. In
  addition to standardizing a format for encoding data, data standards allow for data
  to be exchanged easily and meaningfully. Standards, commonly, enable applications
  to easily communicate and pass data to one another; however, this seamless communication
  between applications is impossible if applications rely on different data standards
  that encode data differently. This thesis proposes a workflow methodology for best-effort
  automatic conversion or translation of meta-data from one data standard to another
  while minimizing the loss of data. The objective of the methodology is to validate
  the conversion and determine the compatibility between two tools and their underlying
  data standards. The standard-enabled workflow and methodology created should analyze
  a given workflow of tools to see if data is lost within the workflow and ensure
  that the data is still compliant with a standard as the data flows through various
  tools. To determine how well the methodology works, Synthetic Biology tools are
  evaluated to see valid connections can be made with other tools while maintaining
  compliance within the data standard supported by the tool.
