abstract: The birth of plastids brought photosynthesis to eukaryotes and had a huge
  impact on their evolution. Despite its importance, details of the plastid acquisition
  process through primary endosymbiosis are not well understood. Recently, a cercozoan
  testate amoeba, Paulinella chromatophora, has received considerable attention because
  it may be able to provide insights into the transition from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont
  to a photosynthetic organelle 1, 2, 3. The P. chromatophora cell contains two chromatophores
  that look like cylindrical cyanobacteria 4, 5, and it has been debated whether these
  chromatophores are endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or photosynthetic organelles 4, 5,
  6, 7. The chromatophore genome of P. chromatophora strain M0880/a was recently sequenced,
  revealing that its size (âˆ¼1 Mbp) has been reduced and that it lacks several genes
  important to cyanobacteria, including a few photosynthetic genes [3]. Here, we obtained
  concrete evidence that psaE, one of the photosynthetic genes, is expressed from
  the nuclear genome of P. chromatophora. This indicates that the psaE gene has been
  transferred into the nuclear genome from the chromatophore. Thus, another primary
  endosymbiotic acquisition of a photosynthetic organelle is under way.
