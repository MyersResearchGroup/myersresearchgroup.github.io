abstract: Systems biology has experienced dramatic growth in the number, size, and
  complexity of computational models. To reproduce simulation results and reuse models,
  researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the latest edition
  of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed for this purpose.
  A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML Level 3 over the past
  decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction-based
  models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types
  including constraint-based models, reaction-diffusion models, logical network models,
  and rule-based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software
  ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models.
  More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new
  data sources such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated
  new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges
  presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed
  to support this evolution.
