abstract: Describes a new method for the architectural synthesis of timed asynchronous
  systems. Due to the variable delays associated with asynchronous resources, implicit
  schedules are created by the addition of supplementary constraints between resources.
  Since the number of schedules grows exponentially with respect to the size of the
  given data flow graph, pruning techniques are introduced which dramatically improve
  the run-time without significantly affecting the quality of the results. Using a
  combination of data and resource constraints, as well as an analysis of bounded
  delay information, our method determines the minimum number of resources and registers
  needed to implement a given schedule. Results are demonstrated using some high-level
  synthesis benchmark circuits and an industrial example.
