abstract: We present an efficient asynchronous VLSI architecture for calculating running
  maximum or minimum values over a sliding window. Running maximums or minimums are
  very useful for many signal and image processing tasks. Our architecture performs
  the calculation using the MAXLIST algorithm. In order to take advantage of the wide
  delay variations due to data-dependencies and operating conditions, an asynchronous
  approach is taken to achieve higher performance and lower power. Simulation results
  demonstrate that our asynchronous architecture is significantly faster than existing
  and potential synchronous architectures.
