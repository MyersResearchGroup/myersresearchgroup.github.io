abstract: This paper proposes applying a logic synthesis approach to high level synthesis
  from SpecC specifications to timed asynchronous gate-level circuits. The state-based
  logic synthesis is used to allow for global and timing optimization. In order to
  reduce the overhead in resetting phases, a protocol called early acknowledgment
  protocol and its STG (signal transition graph) generation technique are proposed.
  In this protocol, the state variables inserted to guarantee that STGs have CSC (complete
  state coding) usually cause no overhead. The experiments to synthesize a portion
  of a DCT circuit show that the proposed method can handle a nontrivial example and
  produce a smaller and faster circuit than a previous approach.
