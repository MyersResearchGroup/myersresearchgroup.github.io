 abstract = {This paper presents several state space reductions for verifying non-trivial asynchronous designs with a compositional minimization approach. These reductions result in a reduced model that contains the exact set of observably equivalent behavior. Therefore no false counter-examples are produced at the end of verification. The experimental results show good scale-up of compositional minimization using these reductions on a number of asynchronous designs.},
