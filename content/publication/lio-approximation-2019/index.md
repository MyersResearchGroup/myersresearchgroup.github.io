abstract: 'This book presents outstanding contributions in an exciting, new and multidisciplinary
  research area: the application of formal, automated reasoning techniques to analyse
  complex models in systems biology and systems medicine. Automated reasoning is a
  field of computer science devoted to the development of algorithms that yield trustworthy
  answers, providing a basis of sound logical reasoning. For example, in the semiconductor
  industry formal verification is instrumental to ensuring that chip designs are free
  of defects (or \"bugs\"). Over the past 15 years, systems biology and systems medicine
  have been introduced in an attempt to understand the enormous complexity of life
  from a computational point of view. This has generated a wealth of new knowledge
  in the form of computational models, whose staggering complexity makes manual analysis
  methods infeasible. Sound, trusted, and automated means of analysing the models
  are thus required in order to be able to trust their conclusions. Above all, this
  is crucial to engineering safe biomedical devices and to reducing our reliance on
  wet-lab experiments and clinical trials, which will in turn produce lower economic
  and societal costs. Some examples of the questions addressed here include: Can we
  automatically adjust medications for patients with multiple chronic conditions?
  Can we verify that an artificial pancreas system delivers insulin in a way that
  ensures Type 1 diabetic patients never suffer from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia?
  And lastly, can we predict what kind of mutations a cancer cell is likely to undergo?
  This book brings together leading researchers from a number of highly interdisciplinary
  areas, including: - Parameter inference from time series - Model selection - Network
  structure identification - Machine learning - Systems medicine - Hypothesis generation
  from experimental data - Systems biology, systems medicine, and digital pathology
  - Verification of biomedical devices \"This book presents a comprehensive spectrum
  of model-focused analysis techniques for biological systems ...an essential resource
  for tracking the developments of a fast moving field that promises to revolutionize
  biology and medicine by the automated analysis of models and data.\" Prof Luca Cardelli
