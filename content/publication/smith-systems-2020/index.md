abstract: Biological models often contain elements that have inexact numerical values,
  since they are based on values that are stochastic in nature or data that contains
  uncertainty. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Level 3 Core specification
  does not include an explicit mechanism to include inexact or stochastic values in
  a model, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML packages to extend the Core specification
  and add additional syntactic constructs. The SBML Distributions package for SBML
  Level 3 adds the necessary features to allow models to encode information about
  the distribution and uncertainty of values underlying a quantity.
