abstract: Rare events are of particular interest in biology because rare biochemical
  events may be catastrophic to a biological system. To estimate the probability of
  rare events, several weighted stochastic simulation methods have been developed.
  Unfortunately, the robustness of these methods is questionable. Here, an analysis
  of weighted stochastic simulation methods is presented. The methods considered here
  fail to accomplish the task of rare event simulation, in general, suggesting that
  new methods are necessary to adequately study rare biological events.
