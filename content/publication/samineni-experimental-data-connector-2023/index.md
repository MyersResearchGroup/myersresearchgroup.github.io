abstract: ' Accelerating the development of synthetic biology applications requires
  reproducible experimental findings. Different standards and repositories exist to
  exchange experimental data and metadata. However, the associated software tools
  often do not support a uniform data capture, encoding, and exchange of information.
  A connection between digital repositories is required to prevent siloing and loss
  of information. To this end, we developed the Experimental Data Connector (XDC).
  It captures experimental data and related metadata by encoding it in standard formats
  and storing the converted data in digital repositories. Experimental data is then
  uploaded to Flapjack and the metadata to SynBioHub in a consistent manner linking
  these repositories. This produces complete connected experimental data sets that
  are exchangeable. The information is captured using a single template Excel Workbook,
  which can be integrated into existing experimental workflow automation processes
  and semiautomated capture of results. '
