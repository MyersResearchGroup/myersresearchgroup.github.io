abstract: This paper presents two symbolic model checking algorithms for the verification
  of analog/mixed-signal circuits. The first model checker utilizes binary decision
  diagrams while the second is a bounded model checker that uses a satisfiability
  modulo theory solver. Both methods have been implemented, and preliminary results
  are promising.
