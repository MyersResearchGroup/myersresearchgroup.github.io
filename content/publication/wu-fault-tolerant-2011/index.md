abstract: Adaptive routing is a sensible approach to enhance fault-tolerance in Network-on-Chip
  (NoC) architectures, but can cause deadlock if implemented improperly. Glass and
  Ni proposed an adaptive routing algorithm based on a turn model which is proven
  to tolerate at least one fault in each routing process and is free of deadlock.
  However, when faults happen on links of a network instead of on nodes, these two
  claims are no longer true. This paper proposes an improved routing algorithm based
  on the Glass/Ni protocol which tolerates a single link fault while still avoiding
  deadlock in a mesh network. Simulation results indicate that this improved algorithm
  provides significant improvements in network reliability with minimal cost.
