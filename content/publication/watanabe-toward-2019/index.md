abstract: Disease modelers have been modeling progression of diseases for several
  decades using such tools as Markov models or microsimulation. However, they need
  to address a serious challenge; many models they create are not reproducible. Moreover,
  there is no proper practice that ensures reproducible models, since modelers rely
  on loose guidelines that change periodically, rather than well-defined machine-readable
  standards. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is one such standard that
  allows exchange of models between different software tools. Recently, the SBML Arrays
  package has been developed, which extends the standard to allow handling simulation
  of populations. This paper demonstrates through several abstract examples how microsimulation
  disease models can be encoded using the SBML Arrays package, enabling reproducible
  disease modeling.
