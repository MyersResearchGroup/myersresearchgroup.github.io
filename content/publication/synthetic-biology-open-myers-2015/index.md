abstract: This volume provides complete coverage of the computational approaches currently
  used in Synthetic Biology. Chapters focus on computational methods and algorithms
  for the design of bio-components, insight on CAD programs, analysis techniques,
  and distributed systems. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology
  series format, the chapters include the kind of detailed description and implementation
  advice that is crucial for getting optimal results in the laboratory. Authoritative
  and practical, Computational Methods in Synthetic Biology serves as a guide to plan
  in silico the in vivo or in vitro construction of a variety of synthetic bio-circuits.
