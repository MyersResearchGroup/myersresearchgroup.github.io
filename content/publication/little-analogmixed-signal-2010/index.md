abstract: Verification of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits is complicated by the
  difficulty of obtaining circuit models at suitable levels of abstraction. We propose
  a method to automatically generate abstract models suitable for formal verification
  and system-level simulation from transistor-level simulation traces. This paper
  discusses the application of the proposed methodology to a switched capacitor integrator
  and PLL phase detector.
