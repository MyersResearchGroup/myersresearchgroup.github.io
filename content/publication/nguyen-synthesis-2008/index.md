abstract: EDA tools have facilitated the design of ever more complex integrated circuits
  each year. Synthetic biology would also benefit from the development of genetic
  design automation (GDA) tools. Existing GDA tools require biologists to design genetic
  circuits at the molecular level, roughly equivalent to designing electronic circuits
  at the layout level. Analysis of these circuits is also performed at this very low
  level. This paper presents a first step at developing a GDA tool that supports higher
  levels of abstraction. In particular, this paper describes a graphical specification
  language from which molecular descriptions can be synthesized. These descriptions
  can then be abstracted to facilitate efficient analysis. I.
