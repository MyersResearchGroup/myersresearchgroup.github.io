 abstract = {EDA tools have facilitated the design of ever more complex integrated circuits each year. Synthetic biology would also benefit from the development of genetic design automation (GDA) tools. Existing GDA tools require biologists to design genetic circuits at the molecular level, roughly equivalent to designing electronic circuits at the layout level. Analysis of these circuits is also performed at this very low level. This paper presents a first step at developing a GDA tool that supports higher levels of abstraction. In particular, this paper describes a graphical specification language from which molecular descriptions can be synthesized. These descriptions can then be abstracted to facilitate efficient analysis. I.},
