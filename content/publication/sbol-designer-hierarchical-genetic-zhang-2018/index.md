abstract: Synthetic biology, as a field of research, applies electrical engineering,
  systems biology, and bioinformatics to genetic circuit design. Software tools are
  leveraged to provide rapid iteration through the design space, and data standards
  are used to encode and characterize complicated genetic circuit designs. Specifically,
  genetic design automation workflows centered around standards, abstraction, and
  decoupling are utilized to help experimental biologists accomplish their goals.
  Unfortunately, the software tools that support this workflow are lacking in some
  critical features such as combinatorial design and support for an extended range
  of glyphs. These inadequacies hinder the adoption of data standards, and therefore
  hurt the reproducibility of experiments and results. Necessary details of experiments
  are not recorded, and the resulting conclusions are therefore not trusted. SBOLDesigner,
  a sequence-based computer aided design tool, addresses these issues. This thesis
  will focus on SBOLDesigner's implementation of combinatorial design and the SBOL
  Visual 2 standard using the SBOL 2 data model. Using SBOLDesigner, experimental
  biologists are able to visualize their genetic circuits unambiguously and express
  the full state of their design robustly. This results in higher productivity when
  designing genetic circuits, more comprehensive circuit descriptions, and most importantly,
  enhanced reproducibility in the field of synthetic biology.
