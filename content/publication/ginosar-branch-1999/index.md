abstract: An instruction execution pipeline in a computer system having variable-length
  instructions uses branch prediction to perform self-timed marking of instructions
  prior to decoding. Branch handling logic is provided in an instruction marking circuit
  to directly mark a target instruction of a predicted branch as the next instruction
  to be decoded. Additionally, a branch target FIFO may be used to store information
  about the location of the target instruction in the instruction stream.
