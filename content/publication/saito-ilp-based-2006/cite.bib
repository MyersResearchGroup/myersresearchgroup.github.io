 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new scheduling method for asynchronous circuits in bundled-data implementation. The method is based on integer linear programming (ILP) which explores an optimum schedule under resource or time constraints. To schedule descriptions with many operations, our method approximate start times of operations and formulate an ILP based on the approximated start times. Because less numbers of variables and constraints are required compared to the traditional ILP formulation, the schedule of operations is determined in short time preserving the quality of resulting circuit.},
