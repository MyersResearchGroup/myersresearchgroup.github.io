abstract: Computational models can help researchers to interpret data, understand
  biological function, and make quantitative predictions. The Systems Biology Markup
  Language (SBML) is a file format for representing computational models in a declarative
  form that can be exchanged between different software systems. SBML is oriented
  towards describing biological processes of the sort common in research on a number
  of topics, including metabolic pathways, cell signaling pathways, and many others.
  By supporting SBML as an input/output format, different tools can all operate on
  an identical representation of a model, removing opportunities for translation errors
  and assuring a common starting point for analyses and simulations. This document
  provides the specification for Version 5 of SBML Level 2. The specification defines
  the data structures prescribed by SBML as well as their encoding in XML, the eXtensible
  Markup Language. This specification also defines validation rules that determine
  the validity of an SBML document, and provides many examples of models in SBML form.
  Other materials and software are available from the SBML project web site, http://sbml.org/.
