abstract: $<$section class=\"abstract\"$><$h2 class=\"abstractTitle text-title my-1\"
  id=\"d394e2\"$>$Abstract$<$/h2$><$p$>$Synthetic biology builds upon the techniques
  and successes of genetics, molecular biology, and metabolic engineering by applying
  engineering principles to the design of biological systems. The field still faces
  substantial challenges, including long development times, high rates of failure,
  and poor reproducibility. One method to ameliorate these problems would be to improve
  the exchange of information about designed systems between laboratories. The synthetic
  biology open language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification
  and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology, filling a need
  not satisfied by other pre-existing standards. This document details version 2.2.0
  of SBOL that builds upon version 2.1.0 published in last year's JIB special issue.
  In particular, SBOL 2.2.0 includes improved description and validation rules for
  genetic design provenance, an extension to support combinatorial genetic designs,
  a new class to add non-SBOL data as attachments, a new class for genetic design
  implementations, and a description of a methodology to describe the entire design-build-test-learn
  cycle within the SBOL data model.$<$/p$><$/section$>$
