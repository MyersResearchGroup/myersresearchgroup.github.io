 abstract = {The articles in this special section focus on analog-mix-signal CAD design. With the advent of "Internet of Things" always connected, sensor-driven electronics are becoming a pervasive part of our lives. Fueled by the commoditization of digital compute capabilities, open source hardware movement such as Arduino, and the relentless advances in biomedical electronics, this trend is only going to accelerate. Yet despite the digital processing that is at the core of such electronics, the environment in which these devices operate is inherently analog. As a result, the analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits are occupying an increasingly large percentage of the die area. In response to this special issue topic, we received eight submissions covering a broad range of topics, including modeling, simulation, optimization, validation, and testing.},
