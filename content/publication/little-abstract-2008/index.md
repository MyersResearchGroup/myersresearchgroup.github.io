abstract: Abstract. Analog/Mixed-signal (AMS) circuit verification is a growing problem
  as process variation increases and AMS circuits become more functionally complex.
  To improve analog verification flows, AMS circuit models are needed at different
  levels of abstraction. This paper discusses recent work and future directions for
  abstract model generation and simulation aided verification of AMS circuits. In
  particular, a CMOS ring oscillator with feedforward inverters is used as a motivating
  example for the work. This example highlights progress and future directions in
  AMS modeling and verification. 1
