abstract: 'With asynchronous circuit design becoming a powerful tool in the development
  of new digital systems, circuit designers are expected to have asynchronous design
  skills and be able to leverage them to reduce power consumption and increase system
  speed. This book walks readers through all of the different methodologies of asynchronous
  circuit design, emphasizing practical techniques and real-world applications instead
  of theoretical simulation. The only guide of its kind, it also features an ftp site
  complete with support materials. Market: Electrical Engineers, Computer Scientists,
  Device Designers, and Developers in industry.'
