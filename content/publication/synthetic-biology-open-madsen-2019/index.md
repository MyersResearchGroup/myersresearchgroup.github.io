abstract: People who are engineering biological organisms often find it useful to
  communicate in diagrams, both about the structure of the nucleic acid sequences
  that they are engineering and about the functional relationships between sequence
  features and other molecular species . Some typical practices and conventions have
  begun to emerge for such diagrams. The Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL
  Visual) has been developed as a standard for organizing and systematizing such conventions
  in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure and function
  of genetic designs. This document details version 2.1 of SBOL Visual, which builds
  on the prior SBOL Visual 2.0 standard by expanding diagram syntax to include methods
  for showing modular structure and mappings between elements of a system, interactions
  arrows that can split or join (with the glyph at the split or join indicating either
  superposition or a chemical process), and adding new glyphs for indicating genomic
  context (e.g., integration into a plasmid or genome) and for stop codons.
