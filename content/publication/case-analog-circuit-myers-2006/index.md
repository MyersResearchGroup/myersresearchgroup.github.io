abstract: The traditional approach to validate analog circuits is to utilize extensive
  SPICE-level simulations. The main challenge of this approach is knowing when all
  important corner cases have been simulated. A new alternative is to utilize formal
  verification techniques. This paper utilizes a simple example to illustrate the
  potential flaws of a simulation-only based validation methodology and the potential
  benefits of formal verification of analog circuits.
