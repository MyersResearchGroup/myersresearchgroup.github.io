abstract: Due to the increasing use and complexity of embedded and cyber-physical
  systems, proper validation of these systems is an increasingly important topic.
  Because these systems are used in safety-critical situations, even intermittent
  failures are unacceptable. Formal verification allows for comprehensive validation,
  but becomes unrealistically complicated for large models. This paper proposes certain
  transforms to simplify system models without removing any of the details required
  for verification. These details must be conservative, in that they may not remove
  any state from the modelâ€™s behavior. These transforms have shown this method promising
  in reducing the complexity of embedded system verification. I.
