abstract: Advantages of formal verification are offset by the difficulties in the
  generating of good system models. This paper presents an improvement to the existing
  method, which generates models from a set of simulation traces. The proposed methodology
  aims to improve model precision by introducing new derivative based discretization
  method. Furthermore, a fine control over model fitness is provided via a notion
  of data rule mining, a novel approach to finding recurring patterns in the input
  data.
