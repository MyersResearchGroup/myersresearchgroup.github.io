 abstract = {Advantages of formal verification are offset by the difficulties in the generating of good system models. This paper presents an improvement to the existing method, which generates models from a set of simulation traces. The proposed methodology aims to improve model precision by introducing new derivative based discretization method. Furthermore, a fine control over model fitness is provided via a notion of data rule mining, a novel approach to finding recurring patterns in the input data.},
