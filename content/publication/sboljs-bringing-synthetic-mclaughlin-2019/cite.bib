 abstract = {The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a data standard for the representation of engineered biological systems. SBOL is implemented in the form of software libraries which can be used to add SBOL support to both new and existing software tools. While existing libraries allow for software to be developed that runs on a server or is installed locally, they lack the capability to create SBOL software that runs directly in a Web browser. Here, we address this issue by presenting sboljs, a JavaScript software library for SBOL that is capable of being used both on the server and in the Web browser.},
