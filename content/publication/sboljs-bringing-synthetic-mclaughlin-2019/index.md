abstract: The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a data standard for the representation
  of engineered biological systems. SBOL is implemented in the form of software libraries
  which can be used to add SBOL support to both new and existing software tools. While
  existing libraries allow for software to be developed that runs on a server or is
  installed locally, they lack the capability to create SBOL software that runs directly
  in a Web browser. Here, we address this issue by presenting sboljs, a JavaScript
  software library for SBOL that is capable of being used both on the server and in
  the Web browser.
