abstract: Standards are essential to the advancement of Systems and Synthetic Biology.
  COMBINE provides a formal body and a centralised platform to help develop and disseminate
  relevant standards and related resources. The regular special issue of the Journal
  of Integrative Bioinformatics aims to support the exchange, distribution and archiving
  of these standards by providing unified, easily citable access. This paper provides
  an overview of existing COMBINE standards and presents developments of the last
  year.
