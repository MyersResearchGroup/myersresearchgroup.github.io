 abstract = {This paper presents an improved timing algorithm for the analysis of timed Petri nets that is based on the POSET algorithm. The new algorithm reduces the number of redundant concurrent orderings the POSET algorithm explores by directly considering causal assignments. This paper shows that the new algorithm, when compared to the original POSET algorithm, results in an average 2.25 times improvement in runtime and a 57% reduction in stored zones when applied to a suite of example circuits. Although the new algorithm can su#er an exponential increase in the number of causal assignments it must consider, this paper shows it to be a property of the POSET algorithm itself that does not happen often in practice.},
