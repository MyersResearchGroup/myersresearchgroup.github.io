abstract: Verification of embedded systems is complicated by the fact that they are
  composed of digital hardware, analog sensors and actuators, and low level software.
  In order to verify the interaction of these heterogeneous components, it would be
  beneficial to have a single modeling formalism that is capable of representing all
  of these components. To address this need, this paper describes an extended labeled
  hybrid Petri net (LHPN) model that includes constructs for Boolean, discrete, and
  continuous variables as well as constructs to model timing. This paper also presents
  a method to verify these extended LHPNs. Finally, this paper presents a case study
  to illustrate the application of this model to the verification of a fault-tolerant
  temperature sensor.
