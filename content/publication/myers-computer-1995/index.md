abstract: In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the design of
  asynchronous circuits  due to their ability to eliminate clock skew problems, achieve
  average case performance, adapt to processing and environmental variations, provide
  component modularity, and lower system power requirements. Traditional academic
  asynchronous designs methods use unbounded delay assumptions, resulting in circuits
  that are verifiable, but ignore timing for simplicity, leading to unnecessarily
  conservative designs. In industry, however, timing is critical to reduce both chip
  area and circuit delay. Due to a lack of formal methods that handle timing information
  correctly, circuits with timing constraints usually require extensive simulation
  to gain confidence in the design. This thesis bridges this gap by introducing timed
  circuits in which explicit timing information is incorporated into the specification
  and utilized throughout the design procedure to optimize the implementation. Our
  timed circu...
