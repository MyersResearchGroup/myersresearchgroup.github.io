abstract: Abstract models of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits can be used for formal
  verification and system-level simulation. The difficulty of creating these models
  precludes their widespread use. This paper presents an automated method to generate
  abstract models appropriate for system-level simulation and formal verification.
  This method uses simulation traces and thresholds on the design variables to generate
  a piecewise-linear representation of the system. This piecewise-linear representation
  can be converted to a Verilog-AMS model or a Labeled Hybrid Petri Net formal model.
  Results are presented for the model generation, simulation, and verification of
  a PLL phase detector circuit.
