abstract: Nitrogen fixation is advantageous in microbial competition when bioavailable
  nitrogen is scarce, but has substantial costs for growth rate and growth efficiency.
  To quantify these costs, we have developed a model of a nitrogen-fixing bacterium
  that constrains mass, electron and energy flow at the scale of the individual. When
  tested and calibrated with laboratory data for the soil bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii,
  the model reveals that the direct energetic cost of nitrogen fixation is small relative
  to the cost of managing intracellular oxygen. It quantifies the costs and benefits
  of several potential oxygen protection mechanisms present in nature including enhanced
  respiration (respiratory protection) as well as the production of extracellular
  polymers as a barrier to O2 diffusion, and increasing cell size. The latter mechanisms
  lead to higher growth efficiencies relative to respiratory protection alone. This
  simple, yet mechanistic framework provides a quantitative model of nitrogen fixation,
  which can be applied in ecological simulations.
