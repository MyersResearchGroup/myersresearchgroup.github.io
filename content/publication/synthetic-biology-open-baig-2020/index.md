abstract: Abstract              People who are engineering biological organisms often
  find it useful to communicate in diagrams, both about the structure of the nucleic
  acid sequences that they are engineering and about the functional relationships
  between sequence features and other molecular species. Some typical practices and
  conventions have begun to emerge for such diagrams. The Synthetic Biology Open Language
  Visual (SBOL Visual) has been developed as a standard for organizing and systematizing
  such conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure
  and function of genetic designs. This document details version 2.2 of SBOL Visual,
  which builds on the prior SBOL Visual 2.1 in several ways. First, the grounding
  of molecular species glyphs is changed from BioPAX to SBO, aligning with the use
  of SBO terms for interaction glyphs. Second, new glyphs are added for proteins,
  introns, and polypeptide regions (e.~g., protein domains), the prior recommended
  macromolecule glyph is deprecated in favor of its alternative, and small polygons
  are introduced as alternative glyphs for simple chemicals.
