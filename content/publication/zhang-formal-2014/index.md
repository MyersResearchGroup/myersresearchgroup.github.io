abstract: A fault-tolerant routing algorithm in Network-on-Chip architectures provides
  adaptivity for on-chip communications. Adding fault-tolerance adaptivity to a routing
  algorithm increases its design complexity and makes it prone to deadlock and other
  problems if improperly implemented. Formal verification techniques are needed to
  check the correctness of the design. This paper performs formal analysis on an extension
  of the link-fault tolerant Network-on-Chip architecture introduced by Wu et al that
  supports multiflit wormhole routing. This paper describes several lessons learned
  during the process of constructing a formal model of this routing architecture.
  Finally, this paper presents how the deadlock freedom and tolerance to a single-link
  fault is verified for a two-by-two mesh version of this routing architecture.
