abstract: ' Synthetic biology research has led to the development of many software
  tools for designing, constructing, editing, simulating, and sharing genetic parts
  and circuits. Among these tools are SBOLCanvas, iBioSim, and SynBioHub, which can
  be used in conjunction to create a genetic circuit design following the design–build–test–learn
  process. However, although automation works within these tools, most of these software
  tools are not integrated, and the process of transferring information between them
  is a very manual, error-prone process. To address this problem, this work automates
  some of these processes and presents SynBioSuite, a cloud-based tool that eliminates
  many of the drawbacks of the current approach by automating the setup and reception
  of results for simulating a designed genetic circuit via an application programming
  interface. '
