 abstract = {Verification of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining circuit models at suitable levels of abstraction. We propose a method to automatically generate abstract models suitable for formal verification and system-level simulation from transistor-level simulation traces. This paper discusses the application of the proposed methodology to a switched capacitor integrator and PLL phase detector.},
