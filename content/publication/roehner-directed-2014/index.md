abstract: As engineering foundations such as standards and abstraction begin to mature
  within synthetic biology, it is vital that genetic design automation (GDA) tools
  be developed to enable synthetic biologists to automatically select standardized
  DNA components from a library to meet the behavioral specification for a genetic
  circuit. To this end, we have developed a genetic technology mapping algorithm that
  builds on the directed acyclic graph (DAG) based mapping techniques originally used
  to select parts for digital electronic circuit designs and implemented it in our
  GDA tool, iBioSim. It is among the first genetic technology mapping algorithms to
  adapt techniques from electronic circuit design, in particular the use of a cost
  function to guide the search for an optimal solution, and perhaps that which makes
  the greatest use of standards for describing genetic function and structure to represent
  design specifications and component libraries. This paper demonstrates the use of
  our algorithm to map the specifications for three different genetic circuits against
  four randomly generated libraries of increasing size to evaluate its performance
  against both exhaustive search and greedy variants for finding optimal and near-optimal
  solutions.
