abstract: Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC) is a valuable tool for automated analysis
  of systems exhibiting stochastic behavior. However, the effectiveness of PMC algorithms
  is limited to systems that can be modeled by a finite state-space. Chemical Reaction
  Networks (CRNs) are commonly used to describe biochemical systems. Since there are
  usually no upper-bounds on the population of species in a CRN, they can only be
  modeled as an infinite-state stochastic model. This paper proposes a new approach
  that can analyze infinite-state CRNs by bounding their state-space. For a property
  indicating that the probability of the event of interest is less than a certain
  threshold value, the objective is to generate a bounded range on the population
  of each species in the CRN such that this bounded CRN already retains sufficient
  probability to refute the property under investigation. The effectiveness of this
  approach is demonstrated by analyzing rare-event properties on a number of biochemical
  systems.
