 abstract = {VisBOL is a web-based visualization tool used to depict genetic circuit designs. This tool depicts simple DNA circuits adequately, but it has become increasingly outdated as new versions of SBOL Visual were released. This paper introduces VisBOL2, a heavily redesigned version of VisBOL that makes a number of improvements to the original VisBOL, including proper functional interaction rendering, dynamic viewing, a more maintainable code base, and modularity that facilitates compatibility with other software tools. This modularity is demonstrated by incorporating VisBOL2 into a sequence visualization plugin for SynBioHub.},
