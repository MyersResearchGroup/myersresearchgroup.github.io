abstract: Researchers are now developing synthetic genetic circuits to manipulate
  the biochemical processes within living cells. In order to model and predict the
  behavior of these circuits, the designer must account for numerous reactions among
  many chemical species and genetic components. The analysis of genetic circuits is
  complicated by the fact that small molecule counts and sporadic gene expression
  makes stochastic simulation necessary. However, the examination of statistics on
  ensembles of stochastic simulation runs can hide important behavior. To address
  this problem, this paper introduces a new method called the incremental stochastic
  simulation algorithm (iSSA) which determines statistics on typical behavior. This
  paper illustrates the utility of this algorithm on a circadian rhythm model and
  a model of a synthetic dual-feedback genetic oscillator.
