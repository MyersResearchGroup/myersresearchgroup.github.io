 abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for verification of asynchronous circuits by using automatic abstraction. It attacks the state explosion problem by avoiding the generation of a flat state space for the whole design. Instead, it breaks the design into blocks and conducts verification on each of them. Using this approach, the speed of verification improves dramatically.},
