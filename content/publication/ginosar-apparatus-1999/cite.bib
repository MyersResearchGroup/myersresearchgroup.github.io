 abstract = {Optimal parallelization of necessarily serial operations is performed by speculative parallel processing and propagation of serial marking signals to indicate valid data. An exemplary instruction marking circuit for a computer system implementing such optimization includes a series of columns, each column corresponding ton one byte of a fixed length instruction line, and a length decoder in each column. Each length decoder receives a byte of the respective column, and performs a length decode independently of the other length decoder. The length decoder asserts a length signal indicative of an instruction length when the byte is the first byte of an instruction. A marking unit arrangement is coupled to the length decoders, and operates to mark each column containing a first byte of an instruction as a function of the length signals asserted by the length decoders.},
