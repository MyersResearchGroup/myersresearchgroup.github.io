abstract: Author summary Information is the cornerstone of research, from experimental
  (meta)data and computational processes to complex inventories of reagents and equipment.
  These 10 simple rules discuss best practices for leveraging laboratory information
  management systems to transform this large information load into useful scientific
  findings.
