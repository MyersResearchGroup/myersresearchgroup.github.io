abstract: This paper describes an investigation of potential advantages and risks
  of applying an aggressive asynchronous design methodology to Intel Architecture.
  RAPPID (\"Revolving Asynchronous Pentium(R) Processor Instruction Decoder\"), a
  prototype IA32 instruction length decoding and steering unit, was implemented using
  self-timed techniques. RAPPID chip was fabricated on a 0.25 /spl mu/ CMOS process
  and tested successfully. Results show significant advantages-in particular, performance
  of 2.5-4.5 instructions/nS-with manageable risks using this design technology. RAPPID
  achieves three times the throughput and half the latency, dissipating only half
  the power and requiring about the same area as an existing 400 MHz clocked circuit.
