abstract: Synthetic biology promises to leverage engineering principles to enable
  model-based design of genetic circuits. To be successful, advancements are needed
  in both experimental and computational methods to support this new approach. This
  paper focuses on the progress on the computational side, the remaining challenges,
  and the road ahead. While much work remains to be done for computational methods
  to truly have impact on experimental synthetic biology, collaborations between computational
  and experimental synthetic biologists have the potential for tremendous impact in
  the areas of health, energy, and the environment.
