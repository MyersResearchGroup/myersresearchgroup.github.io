abstract: $<$section class=\"abstract\"$><$h2 class=\"abstractTitle text-title my-1\"
  id=\"d1131e2\"$>$Summary$<$/h2$><$p$>$ Standards shape our everyday life. From nuts
  and bolts to electronic devices and technological processes, standardised products
  and processes are all around us. Standards have technological and economic benefits,
  such as making information exchange, production, and services more efficient. However,
  novel, innovative areas often either lack proper standards, or documents about standards
  in these areas are not available from a centralised platform or formal body (such
  as the International Standardisation Organisation).$<$/p$><$p$>$Systems and synthetic
  biology is a relatively novel area, and it is only in the last decade that the standardisation
  of data, information, and models related to systems and synthetic biology has become
  a community-wide effort. Several open standards have been established and are under
  continuous development as a community initiative. COMBINE, the `COmputational Modeling
  in BIology' NEtwork [1] has been established as an umbrella initiative to coordinate
  and promote the development of the various community standards and formats for computational
  models. There are yearly two meeting, HARMONY (Hackathons on Resources for Modeling
  in Biology), Hackathon-type meetings with a focus on development of the support
  for standards, and COMBINE forums, workshop-style events with oral presentations,
  discussion, poster, and breakout sessions for further developing the standards.
  For more information see http://co.mbine.org/.$<$/p$><$p$>$So far the different
  standards were published and made accessible through the standards' web-pages or
  preprint services. The aim of this special issue is to provide a single, easily
  accessible and citable platform for the publication of standards in systems and
  synthetic biology. This special issue is intended to serve as a central access point
  to standards and related initiatives in systems and synthetic biology, it will be
  published annually to provide an opportunity for standard development groups to
  communicate updated specifications.$<$/p$><$/section$>$
