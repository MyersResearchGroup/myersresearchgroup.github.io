abstract: A synthetic biology workflow is composed of data repositories that provide
  information about genetic parts, sequence-level design tools to compose these parts
  into circuits, visualization tools to depict these designs, genetic design tools
  to select parts to create systems, and modeling and simulation tools to evaluate
  alternative design choices. Data standards enable the ready exchange of information
  within such a workflow, allowing repositories and tools to be connected from a diversity
  of sources. The present paper describes one such workflow that utilizes, among others,
  the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) to describe genetic designs, the Systems
  Biology Markup Language to model these designs, and SBOL Visual to visualize these
  designs. We describe how a standard-enabled workflow can be used to produce types
  of design information, including multiple repositories and software tools exchanging
  information using a variety of data standards. Recently, the ACS Synthetic Biology
  journal has recommended the use of SBOL in their publications.
