abstract: A fault-tolerant routing algorithm in Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures
  provides adaptivity for on-chip communications. Adding fault-tolerance adaptivity
  to a routing algorithm increases its design complexity and makes it prone to deadlock
  and other problems if improperly implemented. Formal verification techniques are
  needed to check the correctness of the design. This paper describes the discovery
  of a potential livelock problem through formal analysis on an extension of the link-fault
  tolerant NoC architecture introduced by Wu et al. In the process of eliminating
  this problem, an improved routing architecture is derived. The improvement simplifies
  the routing architecture, enabling successful verification using the CADP verification
  toolbox. The routing algorithm is proven to have several desirable properties including
  deadlock and livelock freedom, and tolerance to a single-link-fault.
