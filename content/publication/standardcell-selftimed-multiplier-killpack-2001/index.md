abstract: This paper describes the design of a standard-cell self-timed multiplier
  for use in energy and area critical synchronous systems. The area of this multiplier
  is bounded by N rather than N/sup 2/ as seen in more traditional combinational parallel
  array designs, where N is the word size. Energy has a polynomial growth with word
  size, but has a coefficient that is much smaller than that seen in a combinational
  array design. Although the multiplier is self-timed, it can be embedded in a synchronous
  system appearing as a combinational element. This paper presents latency, area,
  and energy estimates for the multiplier implemented at various word sizes, and compares
  these numbers with a traditional combinational array multiplier. The self-timed
  multiplier uses 1/3 the energy and 1/7 the area of the combinational design for
  a 24-bit word size.
