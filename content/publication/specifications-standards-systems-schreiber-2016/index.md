abstract: Standards are essential to the advancement of science and technology. In
  systems and synthetic biology, numerous standards and associated tools have been
  developed over the last 16 years. This special issue of the Journal of Integrative
  Bioinformatics aims to support the exchange, distribution and archiving of these
  standards, as well as to provide centralised and easily citable access to them.
