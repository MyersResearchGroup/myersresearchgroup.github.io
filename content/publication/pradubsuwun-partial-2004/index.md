abstract: This paper proposes a partial order reduction algorithm for timed trace
  theoretic verification in order to detect both safety failures and timing failures
  of timed circuits efficiently. This algorithm is based on the framework of timed
  trace theoretic verification according to the original untimed trace theory. Consequently,
  its conformance checking supports hierarchical verification. Experimenting with
  the STARI circuits, the proposed approach shows its effectiveness.
