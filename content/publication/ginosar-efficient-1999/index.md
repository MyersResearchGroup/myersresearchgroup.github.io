abstract: A self-timed instruction marking circuit includes a long instruction processing
  system to divide long instruction processing between two columns of the instruction
  marking circuit. Length decoders are interconnected across columns to signal the
  presence and length of long instructions. Self-timed marking can continue without
  alteration. The number of connections required by the instruction marking circuit
  are reduced. The marking process can be optimized to efficiently process all instructions
  by setting the definition of a long instruction such that commonly executed instructions
  are not included.
