 abstract = {In automating the verification of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits, it essential to have a specification language that can describe the behavior that needs to be checked. Although powerful and very expressive, many such languages have a steep learning curve for designers and are complicated to use. This paper describes a simpler, more intuitive language called the Language for Analog/Mixed-Signal Properties (LAMP) that is incorporated into our LEMA verification tool, and demonstrates how this language can be used for AMS verification.},
