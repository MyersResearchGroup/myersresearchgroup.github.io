abstract: In automating the verification of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits, it
  essential to have a specification language that can describe the behavior that needs
  to be checked. Although powerful and very expressive, many such languages have a
  steep learning curve for designers and are complicated to use. This paper describes
  a simpler, more intuitive language called the Language for Analog/Mixed-Signal Properties
  (LAMP) that is incorporated into our LEMA verification tool, and demonstrates how
  this language can be used for AMS verification.
