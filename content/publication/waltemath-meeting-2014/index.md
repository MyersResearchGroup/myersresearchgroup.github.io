abstract: The Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE) is an initiative
  to coordinate the development of community standards and formats in computational
  systems biology and related fields. This report summarizes the topics and activities
  of the fourth edition of the annual COMBINE meeting, held in Paris during September
  16-20 2013, and attended by a total of 96 people. This edition pioneered a first
  day devoted to modeling approaches in biology, which attracted a broad audience
  of scientists thanks to a panel of renowned speakers. During subsequent days, discussions
  were held on many subjects including the introduction of new features in the various
  COMBINE standards, new software tools that use the standards, and outreach efforts.
  Significant emphasis went into work on extensions of the SBML format, and also into
  community-building. This year’s edition once again demonstrated that the COMBINE
  community is thriving, and still manages to help coordinate activities between different
  standards in computational systems biology.
