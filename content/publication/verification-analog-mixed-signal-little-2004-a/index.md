abstract: Embedded systems are composed of a heterogeneous collection of digital,
  analog, and mixed-signal hardware components. This paper presents a method for the
  verification of systems composed of such a variety of components. This method utilizes
  a new model, timed hybrid Petri nets (THPN), to model these circuits. In particular,
  this paper describes an efficient, approximate algorithm to find the reachable states
  of a THPN model. Using this state space, desired properties specified in ACTL are
  verified. To demonstrate these methodologies, a few hybrid automata benchmarks,
  a tunnel diode oscillator, and a phase-locked loop are modeled and analyzed using
  THPNs.
