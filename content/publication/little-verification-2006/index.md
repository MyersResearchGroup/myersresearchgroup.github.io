abstract: System on a chip design results in the integration of digital, analog, and
  mixed-signal circuits on the same substrate which further complicates the already
  difficult validation problem. This paper presents a new model, labeled hybrid Petri
  nets (LHPNs), that is developed to be capable of modeling such a heterogeneous set
  of components. This paper also describes a compiler from VHDL-AMS to LHPNs. To support
  formal verification, this paper presents an efficient zone-based state space exploration
  algorithm for LHPNs. This algorithm uses a process known as warping to allow zones
  to describe continuous variables that may be changing at variable rates. Finally,
  this paper describes the application of this algorithm to a couple of analog/mixed-signal
  circuit examples
