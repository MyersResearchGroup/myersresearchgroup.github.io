abstract: The iBioSim tool is being developed to facilitate the construction and simulation
  of synthetic genetic circuits. In this project, we have created a user interface
  that is similar to those used to construct schematic diagrams which are familiar
  to electrical engineers. Promoters, chemical species, and biological relationships
  can be placed visually on a schematic diagram. Another enhancement was the creation
  of a new simulation visualization tool which allows the user to associate chemical
  species with color schemes, opacity, and cell size. This tool allows the user to
  see the cells behavior as if through a microscope.
