abstract: COMBINE (Computational Modeling in Biology Network) is a consortium of groups
  involved in the development of open community standards and formats used in computational
  modeling in biology. COMBINE's aim is to act as a coordinator, facilitator, and
  resource for different standardization efforts whose domains of use cover related
  areas of the computational biology space. In this perspective article, we summarize
  COMBINE, its general organization, and the community standards and other efforts
  involved in it. Our goals are to help guide readers toward standards that may be
  suitable for their research activities, as well as to direct interested readers
  to relevant communities where they can best expect to receive assistance in how
  to develop interoperable computational models.
