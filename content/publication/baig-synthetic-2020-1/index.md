abstract: Synthetic biology builds upon genetics, molecular biology, and metabolic
  engineering by applying engineering principles to the design of biological systems.
  When designing a synthetic system, synthetic biologists need to exchange information
  about multiple types of molecules, the intended behavior of the system, and actual
  experimental measurements. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been developed
  as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information
  in synthetic biology, following an open community process involving both wet bench
  scientists and dry scientific modelers and software developers, across academia,
  industry, and other institutions. This document describes SBOL 3.0.0, which condenses
  and simplifies previous versions of SBOL based on experiences in deployment across
  a variety of scientific and industrial settings. In particular, SBOL 3.0.0, (1)
  separates sequence features from part/sub-part relationships, (2) renames Component
  Definition/Component to Component/Sub-Component, (3) merges Component and Module
  classes, (4) ensures consistency between data model and ontology terms, (5) extends
  the means to define and reference Sub-Components, (6) refines requirements on object
  URIs, (7) enables graph-based serialization, (8) moves Systems Biology Ontology
  (SBO) for Component types, (9) makes all sequence associations explicit, (10) makes
  interfaces explicit, (11) generalizes Sequence Constraints into a general structural
  Constraint class, and (12) expands the set of allowed constraints.
