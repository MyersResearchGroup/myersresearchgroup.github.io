abstract: The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a standard that enables collaborative
  engineering of biological systems across different institutions and tools. SBOL
  is developed through careful consideration of recent synthetic biology trends, real
  use cases, and consensus among leading researchers in the field and members of commercial
  biotechnology enterprises. We demonstrate and discuss how a set of SBOL-enabled
  software tools can form an integrated, cross-organizational workflow to recapitulate
  the design of one of the largest published genetic circuits to date, a 4-input AND
  sensor. This design encompasses the structural components of the system, such as
  its DNA, RNA, small molecules, and proteins, as well as the interactions between
  these components that determine the system’s behavior/function. The demonstrated
  workflow and resulting circuit design illustrate the utility of SBOL 2.0 in automating
  the exchange of structural and functional specifications for genetic parts, devices,
  and the biological systems in which they operate.
