 abstract = {The design and synthesis of asynchronous circuits is gaining importance in both the industrial and academic worlds. Timed circuits are a class of asynchronous circuits that incorporate explicit timing information in the specification. This information is used throughout the synthesis procedure to optimize the design. In order to synthesize a timed circuit, it is necessary to explore the timed state space of the specification. The memory required to store the timed state space of a complex specification can be prohibitive for large designs when explicit representation methods are used. This paper describes the application of BDDs and MTBDDs to the representation of timed state spaces and the synthesis of timed circuits. These implicit techniques significantly improve the memory efficiency of timed state space exploration and allow more complex designs to be synthesized. Implicit methods also allow the derivation of solution spaces containing all valid solutions to the synthesis problem facilitating subsequent optimization and technology mapping steps.},
