abstract: The design and synthesis of asynchronous circuits is gaining importance
  in both the industrial and academic worlds. Timed circuits are a class of asynchronous
  circuits that incorporate explicit timing information in the specification. This
  information is used throughout the synthesis procedure to optimize the design. In
  order to synthesize a timed circuit, it is necessary to explore the timed state
  space of the specification. The memory required to store the timed state space of
  a complex specification can be prohibitive for large designs when explicit representation
  methods are used. This paper describes the application of BDDs and MTBDDs to the
  representation of timed state spaces and the synthesis of timed circuits. These
  implicit techniques significantly improve the memory efficiency of timed state space
  exploration and allow more complex designs to be synthesized. Implicit methods also
  allow the derivation of solution spaces containing all valid solutions to the synthesis
  problem facilitating subsequent optimization and technology mapping steps.
