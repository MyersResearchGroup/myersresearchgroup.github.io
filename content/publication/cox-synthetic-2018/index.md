abstract: People who are engineering biological organisms often find it useful to
  communicate in diagrams, both about the structure of the nucleic acid sequences
  that they are engineering and about the functional relationships between sequence
  features and other molecular species. Some typical practices and conventions have
  begun to emerge for such diagrams. The Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL
  Visual) has been developed as a standard for organizing and systematizing such conventions
  in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure and function
  of genetic designs. This document details version 2.0 of SBOL Visual, which builds
  on the prior SBOL Visual 1.0 standard by expanding diagram syntax to include functional
  interactions and molecular species, making the relationship between diagrams and
  the SBOL data model explicit, supporting families of symbol variants, clarifying
  a number of requirements and best practices, and significantly expanding the collection
  of diagram glyphs.
