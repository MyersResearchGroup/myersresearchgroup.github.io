abstract: This special issue of the Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics presents
  an overview of COMBINE standards and their latest specifications. The standards
  cover representation formats for computational modeling in synthetic and systems
  biology and include BioPAX, CellML, NeuroML, SBML, SBGN, SBOL and SED-ML. The articles
  in this issue contain updated specifications of SBGN Process Description Level 1
  Version 2, SBML Level 3 Core Version 2 Release 2, SBOL Version 2.3.0, and SBOL Visual
  Version 2.1.
