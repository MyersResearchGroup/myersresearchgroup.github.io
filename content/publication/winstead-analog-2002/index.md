abstract: A method is presented for analog soft-decision decoding of block product
  codes (block turbo codes). Extrinsic information is exchanged as analog signals
  between component row and column decoders. The component MAP decoders use low-power
  analog computation in subthreshold CMOS circuits to implement the sum-product algorithm.
  An example decoder design is presented for a (16, 11)/sup 2/ Hamming code.
