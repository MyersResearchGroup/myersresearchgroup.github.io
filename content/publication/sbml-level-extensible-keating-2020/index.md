abstract: Abstract Systems biology has experienced dramatic growth in the number,
  size, and complexity of computational models. To reproduce simulation results and
  reuse models, researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review
  the latest edition of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed
  for this purpose. A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML Level
  3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing
  reaction-based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to
  other model types including constraint-based models, reaction-diffusion models,
  logical network models, and rule-based models. The format leverages two decades
  of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build
  and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole
  cells and organs, and new data sources such as single-cell measurements and live
  imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our
  perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level
  3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution.
