abstract: textlessspan class=\"jp-italic\"textgreaterAzotobacter vinelandiitextless/spantextgreater
  has been studied for over 100 years since its discovery as an aerobic nitrogen-fixing
  organism. This species has proved useful for the study of many different biological
  systems, including enzyme kinetics and the genetic code. It has been especially
  useful in working out the structures and mechanisms of different nitrogenase enzymes,
  how they can function in oxic environments and the interactions of nitrogen fixation
  with other aspects of metabolism. Interest in studying textlessspan class=\"jp-italic\"textgreaterA.
  vinelandiitextless/spantextgreater has waned in recent decades, but this bacterium
  still possesses great potential for new discoveries in many fields and commercial
  applications. The species is of interest for research because of its genetic pliability
  and natural competence. Its features of particular interest to industry are its
  ability to produce multiple valuable polymers – bioplastic and alginate in particular;
  its nitrogen-fixing prowess, which could reduce the need for synthetic fertilizer
  in agriculture and industrial fermentations, via coculture; its production of potentially
  useful enzymes and metabolic pathways; and even its biofuel production abilities.
  This review summarizes the history and potential for future research using this
  versatile microbe.,
