 abstract = {\textlessspan class="jp-italic"\textgreaterAzotobacter vinelandii\textless/span\textgreater has been studied for over 100 years since its discovery as an aerobic nitrogen-fixing organism. This species has proved useful for the study of many different biological systems, including enzyme kinetics and the genetic code. It has been especially useful in working out the structures and mechanisms of different nitrogenase enzymes, how they can function in oxic environments and the interactions of nitrogen fixation with other aspects of metabolism. Interest in studying \textlessspan class="jp-italic"\textgreaterA. vinelandii\textless/span\textgreater has waned in recent decades, but this bacterium still possesses great potential for new discoveries in many fields and commercial applications. The species is of interest for research because of its genetic pliability and natural competence. Its features of particular interest to industry are its ability to produce multiple valuable polymers – bioplastic and alginate in particular; its nitrogen-fixing prowess, which could reduce the need for synthetic fertilizer in agriculture and industrial fermentations, via coculture; its production of potentially useful enzymes and metabolic pathways; and even its biofuel production abilities. This review summarizes the history and potential for future research using this versatile microbe.,},
