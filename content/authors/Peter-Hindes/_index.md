Peter Hindes is a third-year undergraduate student in the electrical and computer science department at CU Boulder. Peter grew up right here in Boulder Colorado and is proud to call this state his home. He is particularly interested in high frequency circuit design techniques. His current project is designing the genetic data repository, [SynBioHub](/author/synbiohub/). In his free time, Peter enjoys spending time playing games, on the screen, or on the court, as well as making new friends.
