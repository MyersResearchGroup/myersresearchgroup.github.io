Nam-phuong Nguyen is a principal scientist at Boundless Bio, a next-generation precision oncology company focused on the understanding and eradication of extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) positive cancers.  EcDNA+ are among the most aggressive of cancers, for which there has been little headway in terms of treatment.   His research focuses on computational methods for the detection of ecDNA in cancer samples and identification vulnerabilities in the ecDNA production pathway so that a potential theurapy can be developed.

He completed his B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Utah.  During his M.S. degree, he worked in Dr. Chris Myer's lab on the development and simulation of a biological asynchronous Mueller C-element.  He completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2014 at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Dr. Tandy Warnow.
