Jet Mante joined the Genetic Logic Lab as a Ph.D. student under the Supervision of Professor Chris Myers. She is a plant scientist whose research focuses on the reuse of data and genetic components in Synthetic Biology. She is expanding her computational skills working on search and curation methods in SynBioHub.

She joined the lab in Utah after her undergraduate in England, and moved to CU Boulder with Professor Myers when he accepted a positon as ECE Departmental Chair. Jet is making the most of the move to Boulder by enjoying the bike friendly city and the many hiking trails.
