I’m a postdoctorate researcher at the Genetic Logic Lab, led by Chris Myers at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research include Synthetic Biology, Genetic Design Automation (GDA), Lab automation, Software Development and Data Standardization.

I’m currently developing a connected and automated DBTL cycle for SynBio using standardized DNA parts, software tools and lab automation in bacteria.

I had leadership positions in different SynBio communities as SBOL Editor, iGEM Engineering Committee, NEUK SynBio Co-chair, and IWBDA 2023 program committee. Previously I participaed as student representative and project leader at IIBMers in Chile.
