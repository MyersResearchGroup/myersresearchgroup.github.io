While in Professor Chris Myers' lab, Leandro worked on modeling and simulation methods for disease models and population models of genetic circuits. Leandro also worked on standards development and contributed to extensions to the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). After graduation, Leandro joined Google as a software engineer.
