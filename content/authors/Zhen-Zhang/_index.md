Zhen's primary interest is in the modeling and verification of concurrent and probabilistic systems. He is interested in developing theories and algorithms to advance formal verification techniques in both conventional and probabilistic settings, and their applications in synthetic biology, robustness verification of deep neural networks, Network-on-Chip (NoC) systems, and cyber-physical systems. Zhen started his research in formal verification of NoC systems and synthetic biology during his graduate study at Dr. Myers' research group. He worked on formal verification of a fault-tolerant NoC routing protocol, stochastic verification of genetic circuits, and implemented a Java library for the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard. Zhen is currently an assistant professor at Utah State University.
