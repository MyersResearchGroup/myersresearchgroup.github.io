This course serves three primary purposes. First, it will familiarize the students with current trends and career opportunities in Computer Engineering through presentations by industry and faculty members. The second aspect of the course is to provide an education and practice on technical writing for engineers. Third, factors that are important in the engineering profession including professionalism, ethics, the impact of engineering in global and societal contexts, lifelong learning, and contemporary issues will be discussed.
