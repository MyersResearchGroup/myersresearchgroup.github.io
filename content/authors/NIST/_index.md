This research successfully advanced SynBioHub, an interactive genetic design repository, by enhancing usability, extensibility, and support for biological data standards. Key achievements include a more intuitive front-end, a modernized back-end with improved authentication and SBOL 3 support, refined plugin capabilities, and a robust testing framework. The project delivered a functional search system, streamlined user management, and improved data submission and visualization. The back-end now provides secure, granular access control and faceted search, while plugin support for visualization and downloads has been implemented. A comprehensive testing infrastructure ensures consistency between SynBioHub1 and SynBioHub3. While SynBioHub2 and SynBioHub3 are still being finalized, this work has laid a strong foundation for their completion. The developed methodologies and improvements will support the synthetic biology community in managing and sharing genetic designs more effectively.
