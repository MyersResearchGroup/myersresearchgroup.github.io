Nathan Barker researched computer algorithms that would learn the genetic regulatory connectivity of genetic networks using time series data while working with Chris at the University of Utah.  After graduation he moved to Southern Utah where he teaches computer science at Southern Utah University.  He is currently serving as the chair of that department.
