William Mo is a PhD Student under Chris Myers at the Genetic Logic Lab at CU Boulder. He is a Draper Scholar in association with the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory and secondarily advised by Draper researcher Chris Vaiana. Before coming to CU, he received a Bachelor's and Master's from UT Austin.

His work focuses on analysis of engineered DNA regions and corresponding biosecurity implications. He is primarily interested in bolstering the detection and evaluation of biotechnology-based threats through understudied mechanisms. He has background in and enjoys both wet and dry lab approaches to bio research.
