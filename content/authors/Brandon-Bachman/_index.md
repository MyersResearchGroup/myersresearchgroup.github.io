Brandon has had a lifelong passion for computing starting in high school and selling his software across the world on bulletin board systems.  In parallel with taking his fair share of courses in rock climbing, scuba diving, and downhill skiing Brandon pursed a degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Utah,  and as a member of Chris Myers graduate studies program, Brandon studied VLSI Design, Asynchronous Circuit Design, and Algorithms for EDA.  In 1998, Brandon joined Hewlett Packard in Cupertino California as a Hardware Design Engineer, working with EDA and leading physical design for several ASIC designs to deliver SuperDome, a 256-way CC-NUMA architecture.   In 2001, Brandon joined Intel Corporation, and worked on the physical design of the first 64-bit microprocessor.   Brandon has since been with Intel for 23 years working on leading projects including ASIC, Microprocessor and SoC Designs, Technology Development and Design Enablement.   Along the way Brandon earned an MBA with specialty in Corporate Entrepreneurship and Managing Technology Innovation.  Brandon has been on assignment in Israel, India, Costa Rica, and France to deliver results across Intel's worldwide organization.  Brandon currently leads Physical Design, Layout Completion, and EDA tools activities as a Director of the Technology Scaling and Platform Solutions group.  Brandon's focuses on enabling the next generation of process technologies, place and route solutions, machine learning applied to  semiconductor physical design, and design on the cloud.  Brandon is an expert in semiconductor physical design, software development, software architecture & algorithms, and building and leading a world-class multi-national organization that deliver solutions.   Brandon loves biking, downhill skiing, and has a favorite beach located on the shores of the Pacific to which he will never divulge the name or location.
