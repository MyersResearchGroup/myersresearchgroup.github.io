The Genetic Logic Lab is run by <a href="/author/chris-myers/">Chris Myers</a>. The research in the lab focuses on the interdisciplinary synthetic biology work in the overlap between electrical engineering, mathematical modelling, and genetic biology. Examples of work include: the creation of genetic design automation programs similar to electronic design automation programs for circuit designs, stochastic verification of genetic models, and a repository for storing and sharing genetic constructs.
