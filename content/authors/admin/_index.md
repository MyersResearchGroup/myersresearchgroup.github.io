The Genetic Logic Lab is run by <a href="/author/chris-myers/">Chris Myers</a>. The research in the lab focuses on the interdisciplinary synthetic biology work in the overlap between electrical engineering, mathematical modelling, and genetic biology. Examples of work include: the creation of genetic design automation programs similar to electronic design automation programs for circuit designs, stochastic verification of genetic models, and a repository for storing and sharing genetic constructs.

<!-- The Genetic Logic Lab is always looking for talented undergraduate and graduate students. If you're interested in working in the new, exciting interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology, feel free to <a href="/#contact">reach out</a>! --> 

We held an outreach event for undergraduate students interested in synthetic biology! <a href="/outreach/">Click here to learn more</a>!
