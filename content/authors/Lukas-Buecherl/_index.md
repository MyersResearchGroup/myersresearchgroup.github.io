Lukas Buecherl's interest lies in synthetic biology and its possible applications in improving human lives. He is currently working in computational synthetic biology and plans to extend his knowledge with wet lab experience. After obtaining a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from the University of Ulm Germany in 2019, he started his PhD at the University of Utah before joining the interdisciplinary quantitative (IQ) biology program at CU Boulder. In his free time, Lukas enjoys hiking or playing the guitar.
