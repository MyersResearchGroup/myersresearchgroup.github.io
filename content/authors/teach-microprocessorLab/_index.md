This is a laboratory class in which groups of students (groups can be of size 3 or 4) design, build, and test a simple computer. The idea is to use your digital design skills from 3700, and your computer architecture knowledge from 3810, and put it all together into an interesting semester-long project. You will receive the design specifications in lecture. You will then interpret the specifications and develop a model of the design using a combination of Verilog and schematics. The model should be simulated. Once validated you will synthesize the design onto the FPGA boards. The design will contain the instruction set design, memory organization, ALU design, control, and input-output design.
