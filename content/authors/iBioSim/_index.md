iBioSim has been developed for the modeling, analysis, and design of genetic circuits. It supports modeling and visualization support for multi-cellular and spatial models, importing and exporting models specified using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), and is one of the first tools to also support the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL).
