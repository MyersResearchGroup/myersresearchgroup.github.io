Currently a data scientist at NORC at the University of Chicago, I use machine learning and statistics to derive actionable insights from data. I have considerable experience designing and leading research as well as developing tools and methods that improve organizationsâ€™ decision-making capacities. My areas of specialty with data science are natural language processing and network analysis, and I regularly program in Python, R, and SQL and use the scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow frameworks for machine/deep learning.
