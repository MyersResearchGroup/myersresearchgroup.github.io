The CHARMME project aims to identify consortia amenable to carry synthetic functions, render them receptive to engineering, design genetic functions to work in never-before-tried species and simulate environments to test engineered microbes. The project focuses on engineering soil extremophiles (Bacilli, Pseudomonads, Acinetobacter, etc) and filamentous fungi/black yeast (Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Cladosporium, Aureobasidium, etc). SynBioHub3 will link new computational tools with CAD/bioinformatics software already in use by Army researchers (e.g., Benchling, Geneious) and will connect to the BioMADE API. 
CHARMME collaborators include research groups from MIT, Caltech, Columbia University, and University of Colorado Boulder. 

This project is supported by Army Research Office under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-22-2-0210. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the funding agencies
