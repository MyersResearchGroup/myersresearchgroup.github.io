The CHARMME project aims to identify consortia amenable to carry synthetic functions, render them receptive to engineering, design genetic functions to work in never-before-tried species and simulate environments to test engineered microbes. The project focuses on engineering soil extremophiles (*Bacilli, Pseudomonads, Acinetobacter*, etc.) and filamentous fungi/black yeast (*Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Cladosporium, Aureobasidium*, etc.). SynBioHub3 will link new computational tools with CAD/bioinformatics software already in use by Army researchers (e.g., Benchling or , Geneious) and will connect to the BioMADE API. CHARMME collaborators include research groups from MIT, Caltech, Columbia University, and University of Colorado- Boulder. 

This project is supported by the Army Research Office under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-22-2-0210. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the funding agencies.
