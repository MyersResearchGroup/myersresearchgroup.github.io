Accelerating the development of synthetic biology applications requires reproducible experimental findings. Different standards and repositories exist to exchange experimental data and metadata. However, the associated software tools often do not support a uniform data capture, encoding, and exchange of information. A connection between digital repositories is required to prevent siloing and loss of information. To this end, we developed the Experimental Data Connector (XDC). It captures experimental data and related metadata by encoding it in standard formats and storing the converted data in digital repositories. Experimental data is then uploaded to Flapjack and the metadata to SynBioHub in a consistent manner linking these repositories. This produces complete connected experimental data sets that are exchangeable. The information is captured using a single template Excel Workbook, which can be integrated into existing experimental workflow automation processes and semiautomated capture of results.
