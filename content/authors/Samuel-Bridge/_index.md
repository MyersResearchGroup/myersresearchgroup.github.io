Samuel Bridge was an undergraduate researcher for Chris Myers at the University of Utah. He joined the lab in 2018 whilst studying  Computer Science. 

During his time at the lab he primarily worked on SBOLDesigner, a tool for genetic circuit design. His interest in Mobile App development eventually inspired him to create an iOS prototype of SBOLDesigner. Later on his desire to create a more user friendly and modern version of SBOLDesigner led to being involved in the creation of SBOLCanvas, another tool, which is web based, for genetic circuit design.

Since graduating, Sam has found himself working as a Software Engineer for Microsoft in Seattle, Washington.
