SBOL Validator/Converter is a simple, easy-to-use software tool that allows for conversion between SBOL/GenBank/FASTA files using the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) 2.0 data model. Some key features of the Validator/Converter include its ability to convert between SBOL, FASTA, and GenBank files and that the tool is web-based which promotes ease of access and allows for central maintenance of validation methods. Additionally, it is accessible through either a web GUI or a RESTful API.
