SeqImprove was designed to fill a need identified for ad hoc curation by synthetic biologists prior to publishing their work, in order to ensure that their data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). It offers an easy way to apply SBOL annotations to sequence data without requiring that the user have an intimate understanding of SBOL's technical specifications.
