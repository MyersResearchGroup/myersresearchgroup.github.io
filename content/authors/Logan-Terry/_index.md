Likes solving puzzles and plays a lot of puzzle games. Got into programming because of video games. Plays a lot of Minecraft. Can solve a Rubik's cube in just over a minute. Interested in operating systems, and compilers.

Made a dungeon crawler using only the built in java libraries in highschool. Also created a networked version of bomberman in highschool. Currently pursuing a Masters in computer science at the University of Utah. Fluent in Java, C++, C#. Experienced in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, REST apiâ€™s, and SQL.

Developed Canvas Project Manager (CPM), an Eclipse plugin that integrates with Canvas LMS to facilitate easy assignment download and submission. Developed Code Evolution Monitor, an extension of CPM that takes minutely snapshots of code, via git, and submits them to a GitLab server for analysis of developer habits. Primarily worked on the backend of sbolcanvas.org during senior capstone, but did some frontend work such as the SynBioHub download/upload dialogs. Currently maintains and updates SBOL Canvas as part of his graduate studies.
