Tramy joined Chris Myer's lab as an undergraduate student working on the development of a java library for the SBOL (Synthetic Biology Open Language) data standard. She then continued as a graduate student working on building computer aided design software for genetic circuits. Specifically, Tramy developed an end-to-end workflow for sequential genetic circuit design. Currently, Tramy is a research engineer at Raytheon BBN Technologies.
