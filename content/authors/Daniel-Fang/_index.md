Daniel Fang is a second-year doctoral student in the computer science department at CU Boulder, studying under Dr. Chris Myers. Before arriving in Colorado, Daniel completed a bachelorâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Utah. He is particularly interested in the intersectionality of synthetic biology and machine learning techniques. His current project is designing the genetic data repository, [SynBioHub](/author/synbiohub/). In his free time, Daniel enjoys spending time in the outdoors, whether in the mountains or on the golf course, as well as with his friends and family.
