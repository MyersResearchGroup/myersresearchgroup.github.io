title: Asynchronous Circuit Design
summary: In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the design of asynchronous circuits due to their ability to eliminate clock skew problems, achieve average case performance, adapt to environmental and processing variations, provide component modularity, and lower system power requirements. There is, however, a widely held belief that asynchronous design is difficult and leads to inefficient and unreliable designs. The goal of this course is to dispel this belief by introducing a systematic approach to the design of asynchronous VLSI systems from a high-level specification to an efficient and reliable circuit implementation. This course will include both hands-on experience with existing CAD tools as well as learn the algorithms within them. Topics will include specification, synthesis, optimization with timing information, performance analysis, and verification.
