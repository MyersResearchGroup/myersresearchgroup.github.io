title: Digital System Design
summary: This course teaches the fundamental theory and design methods for digital systems. Topics include logic functions minimization, combinational circuit design, synchronous and asynchronous sequential circuit design, state diagrams, Mealy and Moore circuits, state minimization and assignment, basic computer organization, and controller implementation. This course also teaches the use of software tools for design, minimization, simulation, and schematic capture of digital systems. The digital systems that are designed will be implemented using MSI, LSI, and field programmable gate arrays.
